## CHEST EXERCISES (3)

### 1. Low Cable Crossover

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Pectoralis Major - Sternal Head (lower chest)
- Pectoralis Major - Clavicular Head (supporting role)

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Anterior Deltoid
- Biceps Brachii (short head, stabilizer)
- Serratus Anterior
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques)

**Exercise Type:** Isolation

**Equipment Required:**
- Dual cable machine with adjustable pulleys
- D-handles or stirrup handles

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Set both cable pulleys to the lowest position on the machine and attach D-handles.
2. Select an appropriate weight (start light to learn the movement pattern).
3. Stand in the center between the cables with feet shoulder-width apart, one foot slightly forward for stability.
4. Grasp a handle in each hand with palms facing upward, arms extended out to the sides at approximately shoulder height.
5. Lean slightly forward from the hips (maintaining neutral spine) to engage the chest muscles.
6. With a slight bend in your elbows (maintain this angle throughout), pull both handles upward and together in a wide arc, bringing them to meet in front of your chest at approximately shoulder height.
7. Squeeze your chest muscles at the peak contraction for 1-2 seconds.
8. Slowly reverse the motion, controlling the weight as you return to the starting position with arms extended to the sides.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Scapular Control:** Maintain scapular depression and retraction throughout the movement to prevent shoulder elevation and maximize pec engagement while protecting the shoulder joint.
- **Arc Pathway:** Focus on creating a smooth, consistent arc pattern rather than pulling straight across—the handles should travel in a rainbow-shaped path to maintain constant tension on the pectoralis major.
- **Tempo Manipulation:** Use a 3-1-3-1 tempo (3 seconds eccentric, 1 second hold at stretch, 3 seconds concentric, 1 second squeeze at peak) to maximize time under tension.
- **Angle Variation:** Experiment with slight variations in the endpoint height (bringing hands together anywhere from lower abdomen to upper chest) to target different regions of the pectoralis major.

### 2. Pec Deck

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Pectoralis Major - Sternal Head (mid-to-lower chest)
- Pectoralis Major - Clavicular Head (upper chest)

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Anterior Deltoid
- Biceps Brachii (short head, stabilizer)
- Serratus Anterior
- Coracobrachialis

**Exercise Type:** Isolation

**Equipment Required:**
- Pec deck machine (butterfly machine)
- Adjustable seat

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Adjust the seat height so that when seated, the handles are at chest/shoulder height and your upper arms are parallel to the floor.
2. Sit with your back flat against the pad, feet firmly planted on the floor.
3. Position your forearms on the vertical pads with elbows bent at approximately 90 degrees, or grasp the handles if your machine has that variation.
4. Begin with arms open wide to the sides, feeling a stretch across your chest (do not hyperextend—stop when you feel a comfortable stretch).
5. Press your forearms or hands together by contracting your chest muscles, bringing the pads or handles to meet in front of your chest.
6. Squeeze your chest muscles for 1-2 seconds at the peak contraction.
7. Slowly control the weight as you return to the starting position, allowing the chest to stretch.
8. Maintain contact between your back and the backrest throughout the entire movement.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Isolation Emphasis:** Minimize shoulder movement by keeping scapulae retracted and depressed against the pad—all movement should originate from horizontal shoulder adduction, not scapular protraction.
- **Elbow Positioning:** Keep elbows at or slightly below shoulder height throughout the movement to maintain optimal line of pull for pectoralis major fibers.
- **Controlled Eccentric:** Emphasize the eccentric (opening) phase with a 3-4 second tempo to maximize muscle damage and hypertrophy stimulus.
- **Mind-Muscle Connection:** Visualize bringing your elbows together rather than your hands to enhance proprioceptive feedback and pectoralis major recruitment.

### 3. Pec Deck Fly

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Pectoralis Major - Sternal Head (emphasis on outer-to-inner fibers)
- Pectoralis Major - Clavicular Head

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Anterior Deltoid
- Serratus Anterior
- Biceps Brachii (short head, minimal involvement)
- Coracobrachialis

**Exercise Type:** Isolation

**Equipment Required:**
- Pec deck fly machine (straight-arm variation with padded levers)
- Adjustable seat

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Adjust the seat so that when seated, the pivot point of the machine arms aligns with your shoulder joints and the handles are at chest height.
2. Sit upright with your back firmly against the backrest and feet flat on the floor.
3. Grasp the handles with palms facing inward (neutral grip) and arms extended but with a slight bend in the elbows (approximately 10-15 degrees).
4. Start with arms extended out to the sides, feeling a stretch across your chest (maintain the slight elbow bend throughout).
5. Bring your hands together in front of your body by contracting your chest muscles, maintaining the fixed elbow angle (do not bend elbows further during movement).
6. Squeeze your chest muscles when your hands meet in front of your chest.
7. Slowly return to the starting position, controlling the weight and allowing your chest to stretch.
8. Maintain the same slight elbow bend throughout the entire range of motion.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Fixed Joint Angle:** The elbow angle should remain constant throughout—this is not a press movement but rather a pure horizontal adduction, keeping tension isolated on the pectoralis major.
- **Scapular Stability:** Pin your shoulder blades back and down against the pad before initiating the movement and maintain this position to prevent scapular protraction and anterior shoulder stress.
- **Arc Path Awareness:** Visualize your hands moving in a wide arc around your torso rather than pulling straight across—this maintains consistent tension throughout the ROM.
- **Peak Contraction Hold:** Pause for 2-3 seconds at the point of maximum contraction with hands together, actively squeezing the chest muscles to maximize motor unit recruitment.

## HAMSTRING EXERCISES (11)

### 4. Bent-Knee Single-Leg Hip Lift

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Gluteus Maximus
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Erector Spinae (lumbar region)
- Gluteus Medius (stabilizer)
- Adductor Magnus
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis)

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Exercise mat or padded surface
- No additional equipment needed (bodyweight)

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Lie on your back on an exercise mat with both knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.
2. Extend one leg straight out, keeping it slightly elevated off the ground or resting on the floor.
3. Position your arms at your sides with palms facing down for stability.
4. Engage your core by drawing your navel toward your spine.
5. Press through the heel of your planted foot to lift your hips off the ground, raising them until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to the knee of your planted leg.
6. Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings at the top position.
7. Lower your hips back down to just above the ground (maintain tension by not resting completely between reps).
8. Complete all repetitions on one leg before switching to the other leg.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Posterior Chain Drive:** Initiate the lift by driving the heel of the working leg into the floor rather than pushing through the forefoot—this cues posterior chain activation and reduces quadriceps dominance.
- **Hip Height Symmetry:** Maintain level hips throughout the movement by engaging the gluteus medius on the working side—avoid rotation or lateral tilting of the pelvis.
- **Controlled Eccentric:** Lower with a 3-4 second tempo to maximize time under tension and hamstring recruitment, particularly in the stretched position at the bottom.
- **Non-Working Leg Position:** Keep the extended leg engaged and slightly elevated (6-12 inches off ground) throughout the set to increase core stabilization demands.

### 5. Elevated Hip Lift

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Gluteus Maximus
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Erector Spinae (thoracolumbar region)
- Gluteus Medius
- Adductor Magnus
- Gastrocnemius (upper fibers)
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques)

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Flat bench or elevated platform (12-18 inches high)
- Exercise mat (optional for comfort)

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Position a flat bench or sturdy platform perpendicular to your body.
2. Lie on your back on the floor with your upper back and shoulders resting on the ground.
3. Place both feet on top of the elevated platform, hip-width apart, with knees bent at approximately 90 degrees.
4. Position your arms at your sides with palms down, or cross them over your chest.
5. Engage your core and press through your heels to lift your hips off the ground.
6. Raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees.
7. Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings firmly at the top of the movement for 1-2 seconds.
8. Lower your hips back toward the ground in a controlled manner, stopping just before touching the floor to maintain tension.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Increased ROM Benefit:** The elevation allows for greater hip flexion at the bottom (stretch position), which increases muscle fiber recruitment and hypertrophy stimulus in the hamstrings and glutes.
- **Heel Drive Mechanics:** Focus on driving through the heels rather than the balls of the feet—this shifts emphasis from gastrocnemius to hamstrings and glutes.
- **Posterior Pelvic Tilt:** At the top position, think about tucking your pelvis under slightly (posterior tilt) while squeezing glutes to maximize gluteus maximus activation and prevent lumbar hyperextension.
- **Pause at Stretch:** Incorporate a 1-2 second pause at the bottom position (hips lowered, maximum hip flexion) to exploit the stretch-shortening cycle and enhance hamstring activation.

### 6. Elevated Single-Leg Hip Lift

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Gluteus Maximus
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Erector Spinae (lumbar and thoracic regions)
- Gluteus Medius (significant stabilization role)
- Adductor Magnus
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Internal/External Obliques, Transverse Abdominis)
- Quadratus Lumborum

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Flat bench or elevated platform (12-18 inches high)
- Exercise mat (optional)

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Lie on your back on the floor with one foot placed on an elevated platform (bench, step, or box) and the other leg extended straight.
2. Position the elevated foot so that when your hip is lifted, your knee is at approximately 90 degrees.
3. Keep the non-working leg straight and either elevated slightly off the ground or extended along the floor.
4. Place your arms at your sides with palms down for stability.
5. Engage your core and press through the heel of your elevated foot to lift your hips off the ground.
6. Raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from shoulders to knee on the working leg.
7. Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings at the top position.
8. Lower your hips back down with control, stopping just before touching the ground, and repeat for all reps before switching legs.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Pelvic Stability Challenge:** The single-leg elevation creates significant frontal and transverse plane instability—actively engage gluteus medius and core to prevent hip drop or rotation on the non-working side.
- **Extended Leg Positioning:** Keep the non-working leg active and extended at hip height throughout the set to increase hip flexor stretch on that side and enhance core activation demands.
- **Tempo Manipulation:** Use a 3-1-3-2 tempo (3 seconds up, 1 second hold at top, 3 seconds down, 2 seconds pause at bottom) to maximize time under tension and unilateral strength development.
- **Foot Position Variation:** Experiment with foot placement on the platform (centered vs. heel hanging off) to alter hamstring involvement—heel hanging off increases hamstring activation.

### 7. Hip Lift (Glute Bridge)

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Gluteus Maximus
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Erector Spinae (lumbar region)
- Gluteus Medius
- Adductor Magnus
- Rectus Abdominis
- Transverse Abdominis

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Exercise mat or padded surface
- No additional equipment needed (bodyweight)
- Optional: resistance band around thighs or barbell across hips for progression

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Lie flat on your back on an exercise mat with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.
2. Position your feet close enough to your body that you can almost touch your heels with your fingertips when arms are extended at your sides.
3. Place your arms flat on the ground at your sides with palms facing down.
4. Engage your core by drawing your belly button toward your spine.
5. Press through your heels and lift your hips off the ground by contracting your glutes and hamstrings.
6. Raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from your knees to your shoulders (avoid hyperextending your lower back).
7. Squeeze your glutes tightly at the top position for 2-3 seconds.
8. Lower your hips back down with control, stopping just before touching the ground to maintain muscle tension.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Glute Dominance:** Pre-activate your glutes by squeezing them for 3-5 seconds before initiating the lift—this establishes proper motor pattern and reduces compensatory hamstring or lower back overactivity.
- **Knee Alignment:** Push your knees slightly outward throughout the movement (external rotation) to engage gluteus medius and prevent knee valgus collapse.
- **Posterior Pelvic Tilt:** At the peak position, posteriorly tilt your pelvis (tuck tailbone under) while maintaining the hip bridge—this maximizes gluteus maximus activation and prevents lumbar hyperextension.
- **Breathing Pattern:** Exhale forcefully during the concentric phase (lifting) to enhance core stability and intra-abdominal pressure.

### 8. Single-Leg Hip Lift

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Gluteus Maximus
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Erector Spinae (lumbar region)
- Gluteus Medius (major stabilization role)
- Adductor Magnus
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Internal/External Obliques, Transverse Abdominis)
- Quadratus Lumborum
- Hip adductors (stabilization)

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Exercise mat or padded surface
- No additional equipment needed (bodyweight)

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Lie on your back on an exercise mat with one knee bent and foot flat on the floor, the other leg extended straight.
2. Position the working foot (bent knee) close to your body, approximately 6-8 inches from your glutes.
3. Extend the non-working leg straight out, either resting on the floor or slightly elevated.
4. Place your arms at your sides with palms down for balance.
5. Engage your core and press through the heel of your working leg to lift your hips off the ground.
6. Raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to the knee of your working leg.
7. Keep your hips level (avoid rotation or dropping the non-working side) and squeeze your glutes at the top.
8. Lower your hips back down with control, stopping just above the ground, and complete all reps on one side before switching legs.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Anti-Rotation Stability:** The unilateral nature creates significant rotational forces—actively brace your core and engage the opposite-side obliques to prevent pelvic rotation toward the working leg.
- **Hip Level Maintenance:** Visualize balancing a cup of water on your pelvis throughout the movement—this cue helps maintain frontal plane stability and equal gluteus medius engagement bilaterally.
- **Extended Leg Height:** Hold the non-working leg at approximately 45 degrees (mid-height) rather than fully extended on the floor—this increases hip flexor flexibility demands and core stabilization requirements.
- **Working Foot Position:** Experiment with foot distance from body: closer position increases quadriceps involvement, further position increases hamstring activation.

### 9. Deadlift

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Erector Spinae (entire length: iliocostalis, longissimus, spinalis)
- Gluteus Maximus
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus
- Quadriceps (Rectus Femoris, Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius)

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Latissimus Dorsi
- Trapezius (middle and lower fibers)
- Rhomboids
- Forearm flexors (grip muscles)
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis)
- Gastrocnemius
- Soleus

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Barbell
- Weight plates
- Lifting platform or flat surface

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Stand with feet hip-to-shoulder-width apart, with the barbell over the midfoot (approximately 1 inch from shins).
2. Hinge at the hips and bend your knees slightly to reach down and grasp the bar with hands just outside your legs (shoulder-width apart or slightly wider).
3. Set your back in a neutral position (slight arch in lower back, chest up) and engage your lats by "pulling" the bar toward your shins.
4. Take a deep breath, brace your core, and create tension throughout your entire body.
5. Drive through your heels and extend your hips and knees simultaneously to lift the bar off the ground, keeping it close to your body.
6. As the bar passes your knees, thrust your hips forward to reach full hip extension (standing tall).
7. Squeeze your glutes at the top but avoid leaning back excessively.
8. Lower the bar by hinging at the hips first, then bending the knees once the bar passes them, returning the bar to the ground with control.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **"Leg Press the Floor":** Rather than thinking about pulling the bar up, think about pushing the floor away with your legs—this cue promotes proper leg drive and prevents the hips from rising faster than the shoulders.
- **Lat Engagement:** Before initiating the lift, create tension by "bending the bar" around your body (external rotation torque) and pulling the bar into your shins—this engages the lats and maintains optimal bar path.
- **Hip Hinge Mastery:** The deadlift is a hip-dominant movement—the hips should move significantly more than the knees, with the majority of movement occurring at the hip joint through posterior chain activation.
- **Breathing and Bracing:** Use the Valsalva maneuver (deep breath into belly, hold, brace abs) to create intra-abdominal pressure and spinal stability throughout the lift—exhale only after completing the rep or at lockout.

### 10. Leg Curl (General)

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Biceps Femoris (both long and short heads)
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Gastrocnemius (medial and lateral heads)
- Gracilis
- Sartorius
- Popliteus

**Exercise Type:** Isolation

**Equipment Required:**
- Leg curl machine (lying, seated, or standing variation)

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Adjust the machine so that the pivot point aligns with your knee joint and the pad rests just above your heels/Achilles.
2. Position yourself in the machine according to the variation (lying face-down, seated, or standing).
3. Grasp the handles for stability and engage your core.
4. Begin with your legs fully extended (or near full extension depending on machine design).
5. Curl your heels toward your glutes by bending your knees, keeping your hips pressed firmly against the pad.
6. Continue until you reach maximum knee flexion (heels as close to glutes as comfortably possible).
7. Squeeze your hamstrings at the peak contraction for 1-2 seconds.
8. Lower the weight with control, resisting the load throughout the eccentric phase, and return to the starting position without fully locking out the knees.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Hip Stability:** Prevent hip flexion during the curl by actively pressing your hips into the pad—any hip movement reduces hamstring tension and transfers load to the hip flexors.
- **Foot Position Variation:** Plantar flexion (toes pointed) emphasizes the hamstrings by reducing gastrocnemius contribution; dorsiflexion (toes up) increases gastrocnemius involvement and overall posterior chain recruitment.
- **Eccentric Emphasis:** Use a 4-5 second eccentric (lowering) phase to maximize muscle damage stimulus—hamstrings respond particularly well to eccentric training for hypertrophy and strength.
- **Partial Rep Technique:** After reaching failure with full ROM reps, perform partial reps in the shortened (peak contraction) range to extend the set and maximize metabolic stress.

### 11. Lying Alternating Leg Curl

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Biceps Femoris (long and short heads)
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Gastrocnemius (medial and lateral heads)
- Gracilis
- Sartorius
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques) - anti-rotation function

**Exercise Type:** Isolation

**Equipment Required:**
- Lying leg curl machine

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Lie face-down on the leg curl machine with the pivot point aligned with your knee joints.
2. Position the pad so it rests just above your heels/Achilles tendons.
3. Grasp the handles for stability and press your hips firmly into the pad.
4. Begin with both legs extended, then curl one leg at a time, bringing your heel toward your glute by bending the knee.
5. While one leg performs the curl, keep the other leg extended and relaxed (or maintain slight tension).
6. Complete the full range of motion on one leg, squeezing the hamstring at the top.
7. Lower that leg back to the starting position with control.
8. Immediately perform the curl with the opposite leg, alternating legs for the prescribed number of repetitions per leg.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Unilateral Focus:** The alternating pattern allows for enhanced mind-muscle connection with each leg individually—focus intently on the working leg rather than thinking about the upcoming rep.
- **Tempo Asymmetry:** While one leg performs a controlled concentric (2 seconds) and eccentric (3-4 seconds), use the rest period for the opposite leg to mentally prepare for maximum contraction.
- **Hip Stability Challenge:** Alternating creates rotational forces—actively engage your core and press both hips equally into the pad to prevent rotation or hip hiking on the working side.
- **Fatigue Management:** The alternating pattern allows for brief intra-set recovery of each leg, enabling higher total volume and time under tension compared to simultaneous bilateral curls.

### 12. Lying Leg Curl

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Biceps Femoris (long and short heads - particularly emphasized)
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Gastrocnemius (medial and lateral heads)
- Gracilis
- Sartorius
- Popliteus
- Erector Spinae (isometric stabilization)

**Exercise Type:** Isolation

**Equipment Required:**
- Lying leg curl machine

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Lie face-down on the lying leg curl machine with your knees just off the edge of the bench.
2. Adjust the leg pad so it rests comfortably just above your heels/Achilles tendons.
3. Align the pivot point of the machine with your knee joints.
4. Grasp the handles provided for upper body stability.
5. Press your hips firmly into the bench and engage your core.
6. With legs extended, curl both heels toward your glutes by bending your knees.
7. Continue the curl until you achieve maximum knee flexion (heels close to glutes).
8. Squeeze your hamstrings hard at the top of the movement for 1-2 seconds.
9. Lower the weight in a controlled manner, resisting the load throughout, and return to the starting position without locking out the knees completely.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Prone Position Advantage:** The lying position places the hips in extension, which pre-stretches the hamstrings (particularly the long head of biceps femoris) and allows for greater activation compared to seated variations.
- **Eliminate Hip Flexion:** A common compensation is hip flexion during the curl—counteract this by actively pushing your pelvis into the bench throughout the entire range of motion.
- **Dorsiflexion Technique:** Pulling your toes toward your shins (dorsiflexion) during the curl shifts more load to the hamstrings by reducing gastrocnemius contribution—use this technique for maximum hamstring isolation.
- **Loaded Stretch Position:** Pause for 1-2 seconds at the bottom (stretched) position under tension to exploit the stretch-reflex and enhance muscle fiber recruitment in the lengthened position.

### 13. Lying Single-Leg Curl

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Biceps Femoris (long and short heads)
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Gastrocnemius (medial and lateral heads)
- Gracilis
- Sartorius
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Internal/External Obliques) - anti-rotation function
- Erector Spinae (isometric stabilization)
- Gluteus Medius (pelvic stabilization on working side)

**Exercise Type:** Isolation

**Equipment Required:**
- Lying leg curl machine (must allow for unilateral training)

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Lie face-down on the lying leg curl machine with one leg positioned under the pad (just above the Achilles) and the other leg either hanging off the side or resting without engaging the pad.
2. Align the pivot point with your working knee joint.
3. Grasp the handles firmly for upper body stability.
4. Press your hips into the bench and engage your core to prevent rotation.
5. With the working leg extended, curl your heel toward your glute by bending the knee.
6. Continue until you reach maximum knee flexion.
7. Squeeze the hamstring at the top of the movement for 1-2 seconds.
8. Lower the weight with control, maintaining tension throughout the eccentric phase.
9. Complete all repetitions on one leg before switching to the other leg.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Bilateral Deficit Advantage:** Training one leg at a time allows for greater force production per leg compared to bilateral training due to increased neural drive—exploit this by using higher relative loads (70-80% of bilateral working weight per leg).
- **Anti-Rotation Core Demand:** The unilateral nature creates significant rotational forces through the pelvis—actively brace your core and think about keeping both hips pressed equally into the pad throughout the set.
- **Strength Imbalance Identification:** Single-leg work reveals left-right discrepancies—if one leg is significantly weaker or has less ROM, allocate additional volume to that side (1-2 extra sets or 15-20% more reps).
- **Mind-Muscle Connection:** Without the distraction of coordinating two legs, you can achieve superior proprioceptive awareness—focus intensely on feeling the hamstring contract and lengthen throughout each rep.

### 14. Seated Leg Curl

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Biceps Femoris (short head - particularly emphasized)
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus
- Biceps Femoris (long head - reduced activation compared to lying variation)

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Gastrocnemius (medial and lateral heads)
- Gracilis
- Sartorius
- Popliteus
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Erector Spinae - isometric stabilization)

**Exercise Type:** Isolation

**Equipment Required:**
- Seated leg curl machine

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Sit in the seated leg curl machine and adjust the back pad so your knees align with the pivot point of the machine.
2. Position the lower pad just above your ankles on your lower legs and the upper pad (thigh restraint) across your thighs.
3. Adjust the thigh pad so it holds your legs securely without causing discomfort.
4. Grasp the handles at your sides or on the thigh pad.
5. Begin with your legs extended (knees straight or nearly straight depending on machine design).
6. Curl your heels down and back by bending your knees, bringing your heels as close to the seat as possible.
7. Squeeze your hamstrings at the point of maximum contraction.
8. Slowly extend your legs back to the starting position, controlling the weight throughout the eccentric phase.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Hip Flexion Advantage:** The seated position places the hips in flexion, which shortens the long head of the biceps femoris and reduces its contribution—this emphasizes the short head of biceps femoris and the medial hamstrings (semitendinosus/semimembranosus).
- **Thigh Pad Pressure:** Maintain consistent pressure against the thigh restraint pad throughout the movement to prevent hip extension compensation and keep tension isolated on the hamstrings.
- **Lean-Back Technique:** Slightly reclining the torso (if machine allows) pre-stretches the hamstrings further and can increase activation—experiment with torso angle for optimal muscle engagement.
- **Isometric Holds:** Incorporate 3-5 second isometric holds at various points in the ROM (bottom stretch, mid-range, peak contraction) to enhance strength across the entire force curve.

## QUADRICEPS EXERCISES (11)

### 15. Barbell Diagonal Lunge

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Rectus Femoris
- Vastus Lateralis
- Vastus Medialis
- Vastus Intermedius
- Gluteus Maximus
- Gluteus Medius (increased activation due to diagonal pattern)

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Adductor Magnus
- Adductor Longus
- Adductor Brevis
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis)
- Erector Spinae

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Barbell
- Weight plates
- Squat rack (for loading barbell onto back)

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Load a barbell onto your upper back/traps as you would for a back squat, standing with feet hip-width apart.
2. Instead of stepping directly forward, step forward and at approximately 45 degrees to the side (diagonal direction).
3. Plant your front foot firmly on the ground, toes pointing in the direction of travel.
4. Lower your body by bending both knees, dropping your back knee toward the ground.
5. Keep your front knee tracking over your toes (not collapsing inward) and your torso upright.
6. Descend until your front thigh is approximately parallel to the ground and your back knee is just above the floor.
7. Push through your front heel to drive back to the starting position, returning your front leg to meet your back leg.
8. Alternate legs, stepping diagonally forward with the opposite leg on the next repetition.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Gluteus Medius Emphasis:** The diagonal stepping pattern increases frontal plane demand, requiring greater gluteus medius activation to control hip adduction and prevent knee valgus—this makes it superior to standard lunges for hip stability development.
- **Torso Positioning:** Maintain a more upright torso compared to forward lunges to keep the load centered over the base of support and increase quadriceps demand.
- **Directional Consistency:** Ensure the diagonal angle remains consistent (45 degrees) across all reps—inconsistent angles reduce the stability challenge and gluteus medius recruitment.
- **Eccentric Control:** Use a 3-4 second eccentric (lowering) phase to maximize time under tension in both the quadriceps and hip stabilizers.

### 16. Barbell Hack Squat

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Rectus Femoris
- Vastus Lateralis
- Vastus Medialis
- Vastus Intermedius
- Gluteus Maximus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Adductor Magnus
- Adductor Longus
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus
- Erector Spinae (lower activation compared to back squat)
- Gastrocnemius
- Soleus
- Core stabilizers

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Barbell
- Weight plates
- Lifting platform or flat surface

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Stand with your back to a loaded barbell on the floor, feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Squat down and grasp the barbell behind your legs with an overhand grip (palms facing behind you), hands shoulder-width apart.
3. Position the bar close to your body at approximately mid-calf level.
4. Set your back in a neutral position with chest up and shoulders back.
5. Take a deep breath, brace your core, and drive through your heels to stand up, lifting the barbell.
6. Extend your hips and knees simultaneously until you reach a fully standing position.
7. Keep the bar close to your body throughout the ascent, brushing against your legs.
8. Lower the barbell back to the ground with control by bending your knees and hips, maintaining a neutral spine.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Quadriceps Emphasis:** The barbell hack squat positions the load behind the body, which shifts the center of mass posteriorly and requires a more upright torso—this increases quadriceps demand while reducing erector spinae involvement compared to conventional deadlifts.
- **Bar Path Management:** The bar should travel in a vertical line close to your body—if the bar swings away from your legs, it creates a longer moment arm and increases injury risk.
- **Knee Flexion Depth:** This movement allows for deeper knee flexion than conventional deadlifts, increasing time under tension for the quadriceps throughout a greater range of motion.
- **Grip Limitation Strategy:** Grip strength often fails before leg strength—use lifting straps once grip becomes the limiting factor to maximize quadriceps overload.

### 17. Barbell Lunge

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Rectus Femoris
- Vastus Lateralis
- Vastus Medialis
- Vastus Intermedius
- Gluteus Maximus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus
- Adductor Magnus
- Gluteus Medius (stabilization)
- Erector Spinae
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis)
- Gastrocnemius
- Soleus

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Barbell
- Weight plates
- Squat rack (for loading barbell onto back)
- Open floor space

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Position a barbell on your upper back/traps as you would for a back squat, standing with feet hip-width apart.
2. Take a large step forward with one leg (approximately 2-3 feet), landing with your front foot flat on the ground.
3. Keep your torso upright and core engaged throughout the movement.
4. Lower your body by bending both knees simultaneously until your front thigh is parallel to the ground and your back knee nearly touches the floor.
5. Ensure your front knee tracks over your toes and doesn't collapse inward.
6. Push through your front heel to drive back to the starting position, bringing your front leg back to meet your back leg.
7. Either alternate legs each rep or complete all reps on one leg before switching (stationary lunge variation).
8. Maintain balance and control throughout the entire movement.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Stride Length Optimization:** Shorter stride lengths (front knee more forward over toes) increase quadriceps activation; longer stride lengths (front knee more aligned with ankle) increase glute and hamstring involvement—choose based on training goal.
- **Torso Angle Variation:** A more upright torso increases quadriceps demand, while a forward lean (maintaining neutral spine) increases posterior chain involvement—use torso positioning strategically.
- **Eccentric Tempo:** Use a controlled 2-3 second descent to increase time under tension and maximize hypertrophy stimulus in both the quadriceps and glutes.
- **Front Foot Pressure:** Distribute weight through the entire front foot, but emphasize heel pressure to maximize posterior chain recruitment and reduce patellofemoral stress.

### 18. Barbell Reverse Lunge

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Rectus Femoris
- Vastus Lateralis
- Vastus Medialis
- Vastus Intermedius
- Gluteus Maximus (increased emphasis compared to forward lunge)

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus
- Adductor Magnus
- Gluteus Medius
- Erector Spinae
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis - increased demand)
- Gastrocnemius
- Soleus

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Barbell
- Weight plates
- Squat rack (for loading barbell onto back)

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Position a barbell on your upper back/traps as you would for a back squat, standing with feet hip-width apart.
2. Take a large step backward with one leg (approximately 2-3 feet), landing on the ball of your foot.
3. Keep your torso upright and core engaged.
4. Lower your body by bending both knees until your front thigh is parallel to the ground and your back knee nearly touches the floor.
5. Ensure your front knee stays aligned over your ankle (not pushing forward over toes).
6. Push through your front heel and drive your back leg forward, returning to the starting position.
7. Either alternate legs each rep or complete all reps on one leg before switching.
8. Maintain balance and control throughout the entire movement.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Anterior Knee Load Reduction:** Reverse lunges keep the front shin more vertical than forward lunges, reducing shear forces at the knee joint—this makes them ideal for clients with patellofemoral pain or ACL concerns.
- **Glute Emphasis:** The backward step pattern requires greater hip extension force from the front leg's glutes to return to standing, increasing glute activation compared to forward lunges.
- **Balance Challenge:** Stepping backward is neurologically more challenging than stepping forward, requiring greater proprioceptive control and core stabilization—progress gradually with load.
- **Torso Stability:** The reverse direction increases the likelihood of torso lean—actively think about keeping your chest up and shoulders back throughout the movement to maintain proper spinal position.

### 19. Barbell Side Lunge

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Rectus Femoris (working leg)
- Vastus Lateralis (working leg - emphasized)
- Vastus Medialis (working leg)
- Vastus Intermedius (working leg)
- Gluteus Maximus (working leg)
- Gluteus Medius (working leg - significantly emphasized)
- Adductor Magnus (both legs - stretched on working side, stabilizing on opposite)
- Adductor Longus (both legs)
- Adductor Brevis (both legs)

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus
- Erector Spinae
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques - significant anti-rotation demand)
- Hip abductors (opposite leg stabilization)

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Barbell
- Weight plates
- Squat rack (for loading barbell onto back)

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Position a barbell on your upper back/traps as you would for a back squat, standing with feet hip-width apart.
2. Take a large step directly to the side with one leg (approximately 3-4 feet), keeping toes pointing forward.
3. Shift your weight toward the stepping leg, bending that knee and hip while keeping the opposite leg straight.
4. Lower your body by sitting back into the hip of the stepping leg, descending until the thigh is approximately parallel to the ground.
5. Keep your torso upright with chest up and maintain both feet flat on the ground pointing forward.
6. Push through the heel of your bent leg to drive back to the starting position, bringing your feet back together.
7. Alternate sides or complete all reps on one side before switching.
8. Maintain balance and avoid allowing your knee to collapse inward.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Frontal Plane Loading:** Side lunges are one of the few exercises that load the frontal plane with significant resistance, making them invaluable for athletic development and injury prevention—most sports involve lateral movement patterns that require frontal plane strength.
- **Adductor Stretch Positioning:** The straight leg experiences significant adductor stretch—maintain active tension through the adductors of the straight leg rather than passively hanging in the stretched position to prevent groin strain.
- **Torso Orientation:** Keep your torso facing forward (not rotating toward the working leg) throughout the movement to maximize core stability demands and maintain balanced loading on the spine.
- **Depth Variation:** Deeper side lunges increase adductor flexibility demands and glute activation, while shallower depths allow for heavier loading and greater quadriceps emphasis—vary depth based on training goals.

### 20. Barbell Split Squat

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Rectus Femoris (front leg)
- Vastus Lateralis (front leg)
- Vastus Medialis (front leg)
- Vastus Intermedius (front leg)
- Gluteus Maximus (front leg)

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Biceps Femoris (front leg)
- Semitendinosus (front leg)
- Semimembranosus (front leg)
- Adductor Magnus (front leg)
- Hip flexors (back leg - Iliopsoas, Rectus Femoris)
- Gluteus Medius (stabilization)
- Erector Spinae
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques)
- Gastrocnemius and Soleus (front leg)

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Barbell
- Weight plates
- Squat rack (for loading barbell onto back)

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Position a barbell on your upper back/traps as you would for a back squat.
2. Step one foot forward and one foot back, creating a split stance approximately 2-3 feet apart.
3. Position your front foot flat on the ground and your back foot on the ball of the foot (heel elevated).
4. Keep your torso upright with core engaged and feet approximately hip-width apart (not on a tightrope).
5. Lower your body straight down by bending both knees until your front thigh is parallel to the ground and your back knee nearly touches the floor.
6. Ensure your front knee tracks over your toes and doesn't collapse inward.
7. Push through your front heel to drive back up to the starting position (split stance maintained).
8. Complete all repetitions on one leg before switching to the other leg.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Static Position Advantage:** Unlike lunges, the split squat maintains a fixed foot position throughout the set, eliminating the balance challenge of stepping and allowing for greater loading potential and more targeted muscular overload.
- **Front Knee Position:** Experiment with front knee tracking: knee directly over ankle emphasizes glutes/hamstrings; knee slightly forward over toes increases quadriceps demand—adjust based on training goals.
- **Hip Flexor Stretch:** The split squat position creates a significant hip flexor stretch on the back leg—maintain active tension through the hip flexors rather than passively hanging to prevent excessive lumbar extension.
- **Stance Width:** A wider lateral stance (not on a tightrope, but feet hip-width apart) increases stability and allows for better balance, enabling heavier loads and more focused work on the front leg.

### 21. Barbell Squat

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Rectus Femoris
- Vastus Lateralis
- Vastus Medialis
- Vastus Intermedius
- Gluteus Maximus
- Erector Spinae (iliocostalis, longissimus, spinalis)

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus
- Adductor Magnus
- Adductor Longus
- Gluteus Medius
- Gastrocnemius
- Soleus
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis)
- Latissimus Dorsi (stabilization)
- Trapezius (upper and middle fibers)

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Barbell
- Weight plates
- Squat rack or power cage with safety bars

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Position yourself under the barbell in a squat rack with the bar resting across your upper traps/rear delts (high bar) or lower on your rear delts (low bar).
2. Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width with hands evenly spaced, creating upper back tightness.
3. Step back from the rack with feet shoulder-to-hip-width apart, toes slightly pointed outward (10-30 degrees).
4. Take a deep breath, brace your core, and maintain a neutral spine with chest up.
5. Initiate the descent by simultaneously bending at your hips and knees, sitting back and down.
6. Descend until your hip crease is at or below your knee crease (parallel or deeper), keeping your knees tracking over your toes.
7. Maintain an upright torso (or appropriate forward lean for low bar), keeping your weight distributed through your mid-foot.
8. Drive through your feet, extending your hips and knees simultaneously to return to the starting position, maintaining core tension throughout.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **"Spread the Floor":** As you descend and ascend, think about pushing your knees outward and "spreading the floor apart" with your feet—this cue activates the hip abductors and prevents knee valgus collapse.
- **Breathing and Bracing:** Take a large breath into your belly before each rep, hold it throughout the descent and ascent (Valsalva maneuver), and exhale only at the top—this creates intra-abdominal pressure and spinal stability.
- **Bar Path:** The bar should travel in a vertical line over your mid-foot throughout the entire movement—any forward or backward deviation indicates suboptimal mechanics and energy leaks.
- **Depth Trade-offs:** Full depth squats (ATG - ass-to-grass) maximize glute and hamstring involvement and overall muscle development, while parallel squats allow for heavier loads and greater specificity to powerlifting competition—choose depth based on goals.

4. Drive through the heel of your elevated foot to step up onto the platform, bringing your trailing leg up to meet the planted foot.
5. Stand fully upright on the platform with both feet together.
6. Step down with the same leg that stepped up (or opposite leg for alternating variation), controlling your descent.
7. Return to the starting position with both feet on the ground.
8. Complete all repetitions on one leg before switching, or alternate legs each repetition.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Lead Leg Drive Only:** Avoid pushing off with the trailing leg—all force should come from the elevated leg pressing through the platform to eliminate compensation and maximize unilateral overload.
- **Platform Height Selection:** Higher platforms increase glute and hamstring involvement; lower platforms emphasize quadriceps—select height based on training goals (16-20 inches for quad focus, 20-24+ inches for glute/hamstring emphasis).
- **Eccentric Control:** Use a controlled 2-3 second eccentric (stepping down) phase rather than dropping quickly—this maximizes time under tension and reduces impact stress.
- **Knee Tracking:** Ensure the knee of the working leg tracks in line with the toes throughout the ascent—prevent knee valgus (inward collapse) by actively engaging hip external rotators and gluteus medius.

### 23. Barbell Walking Lunge

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Rectus Femoris
- Vastus Lateralis
- Vastus Medialis
- Vastus Intermedius
- Gluteus Maximus

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus
- Adductor Magnus
- Gluteus Medius (significant stabilization role)
- Erector Spinae
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis - enhanced demand)
- Hip flexors (trailing leg)
- Gastrocnemius and Soleus

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Barbell
- Weight plates
- Squat rack (for loading barbell onto back)
- Open floor space or walking path (minimum 20-30 feet)

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Position a barbell on your upper back/traps as you would for a back squat, standing with feet hip-width apart.
2. Take a large step forward with one leg (approximately 2-3 feet), landing with your front foot flat on the ground.
3. Lower your body by bending both knees until your front thigh is parallel to the ground and your back knee nearly touches the floor.
4. Instead of pushing back to the starting position, push through your front heel and bring your back leg forward, stepping into the next lunge.
5. Continue alternating legs with each step, walking forward in a straight line.
6. Maintain an upright torso with core engaged throughout the entire walking pattern.
7. Ensure each front knee tracks over the toes and doesn't collapse inward.
8. Continue for the prescribed distance or number of repetitions per leg.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Dynamic Stability Challenge:** Unlike stationary lunges, walking lunges require continuous balance adjustments and proprioceptive control between each rep—this increases core activation and functional carryover to athletic movement.
- **Momentum Management:** Avoid using momentum to "bounce" between reps—each lunge should be controlled through the full ROM before initiating the next step to maximize time under tension.
- **Stride Consistency:** Maintain consistent stride length throughout the set—shortening stride as fatigue sets in indicates compensatory patterns and reduced movement quality.
- **Forward Lean Prevention:** The continuous forward motion increases the tendency to lean forward—actively think about keeping your chest up and shoulders back throughout the walking pattern.

### 24. Diagonal Lunge

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Rectus Femoris
- Vastus Lateralis
- Vastus Medialis
- Vastus Intermedius
- Gluteus Maximus
- Gluteus Medius (enhanced activation due to diagonal pattern)

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Adductor Magnus

- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis - increased demand)
- Erector Spinae
- Hip rotators

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- None (bodyweight)
- Optional: dumbbells or kettlebell for resistance progression

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart, hands at your sides or on your hips.
2. Step forward and at approximately 45 degrees to the side (diagonal direction) with one leg.
3. Plant your front foot firmly, with toes pointing in the direction of travel.
4. Lower your body by bending both knees until your front thigh is approximately parallel to the ground and your back knee approaches the floor.
5. Keep your front knee tracking over your toes and maintain an upright torso.
6. Push through your front heel to return to the starting position, bringing your front leg back to meet your back leg.
7. Alternate legs, stepping diagonally forward with the opposite leg on the next repetition.
8. Maintain balance and control throughout the movement pattern.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Three-Dimensional Loading:** The diagonal angle creates demands in the sagittal (forward/back), frontal (side-to-side), and transverse (rotational) planes simultaneously—this makes it highly functional for sports that require multidirectional movement.
- **Gluteus Medius Recruitment:** The diagonal direction significantly increases gluteus medius activation compared to straight-forward lunges, making it superior for hip stability development and knee injury prevention.
- **Directional Precision:** Maintain a consistent 45-degree angle across all reps—use a visual target or floor markings initially to train proper directional control.
- **Torso Alignment:** Keep your torso facing forward (not rotating toward the stepping leg) throughout the movement to maximize core stability demands and maintain balanced spinal loading.

### 25. Dumbbell Diagonal Lunge

**Primary Muscles Worked:**
- Rectus Femoris
- Vastus Lateralis
- Vastus Medialis
- Vastus Intermedius
- Gluteus Maximus
- Gluteus Medius (enhanced activation)

**Secondary Muscles Worked:**
- Adductor Magnus
- Adductor Longus
- Biceps Femoris
- Semitendinosus
- Semimembranosus
- Core stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis)
- Erector Spinae
- Trapezius (upper fibers - for holding dumbbells)
- Forearm flexors (grip muscles)
- Deltoids (stabilization for holding dumbbells)

**Exercise Type:** Compound

**Equipment Required:**
- Pair of dumbbells

**Beginner Instructions:**
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides with palms facing your body.
2. Step forward and at approximately 45 degrees to the side (diagonal direction) with one leg.
3. Plant your front foot firmly on the ground with toes pointing in the direction of travel.
4. Lower your body by bending both knees until your front thigh is approximately parallel to the ground and your back knee approaches the floor.
5. Keep the dumbbells hanging at your sides throughout the movement and maintain an upright torso.
6. Ensure your front knee tracks over your toes without collapsing inward.
7. Push through your front heel to drive back to the starting position, bringing your front leg back to meet your back leg.
8. Alternate legs, stepping diagonally forward with the opposite leg on the next repetition.

**Advanced Coaching Cues:**
- **Load Position Variation:** Dumbbells allow for multiple load positions (at sides, at shoulders, overhead)—experiment with different positions to alter the challenge: sides = standard; shoulders = increased stability demand; overhead = maximum core activation.
- **Independent Loading:** Dumbbells allow for unilateral loading (holding weight only on one side) to create anti-lateral flexion core demands and address imbalances.
- **Grip Strength Integration:** The continuous holding of dumbbells throughout the set adds significant forearm and grip training stimulus—use heavier weights or extend set duration to challenge grip endurance.
- **Controlled Descent:** Use a 2-3 second eccentric tempo to maximize time under tension in both the lower body and the stabilizing muscles required to control the dumbbells throughout the movement.
