## TRICEPS EXERCISES (22 exercises)

1. | LYING CABLE TRICEPS EXTENSION | Triceps Brachii (Long Head, Lateral Head, Medial Head) | Anconeus | Isolation | Cable machine with straight bar or rope attachment | Intermediate | Upper | Push | Cables | 1. Set cable pulley to lowest position and attach straight bar or rope handle 2. Lie supine on bench positioned 2-3 feet from cable station with head toward pulley 3. Grasp attachment with arms extended overhead, elbows bent at 90 degrees 4. Keep upper arms stationary and perpendicular to floor throughout movement 5. Extend elbows by contracting triceps until arms are fully straightened 6. Lower weight under control, allowing elbows to bend to 90 degrees 7. Maintain consistent tension on cable throughout entire range of motion | 1. Keep upper arms locked in vertical position to isolate triceps and prevent shoulder recruitment 2. Pause briefly at full elbow extension to maximize medial head activation 3. Use slow eccentric phase (3-4 seconds) to increase time under tension 4. Maintain constant cable tension by avoiding full relaxation at bottom position | 1. Maeo S, Wu Y, Huang M, et al. (2023).

Extend elbows to raise bar in arc motion toward ceiling 6. Stop when arms are fully extended but not locked out 7. Lower bar under control back to start position behind head | 1. Overhead arm position (shoulder flexion) maximizes long head stretch and activation 2. Allow upper arms to drift back slightly beyond vertical to increase long head tension 3. Maintain shoulder stability by engaging lats throughout movement 4. Use moderate loads (60-70% 1RM) to maintain control and prevent shoulder stress | 1. Maeo S, Wu Y, Huang M, et al. (2023).

Lower bar toward forehead by bending elbows while keeping upper arms perpendicular to floor 5. Stop when forearms reach parallel to floor (approximately 90-degree elbow flexion) 6. Extend elbows forcefully to return bar to start position 7. Maintain reverse grip throughout entire range of motion | 1. Reverse grip increases medial head activation compared to standard overhand grip 2. Use 20-30% less load than standard lying extensions due to weaker grip position 3. Keep wrists neutral to prevent excessive forearm strain from supinated position 4. Focus on controlled tempo (2-second concentric, 3-second eccentric) for muscle hypertrophy 5.

27. | ISOMETRIC NECK FLEXION (4-WAY NECK MACHINE) | Sternocleidomastoid, Scalenes (Anterior, Middle, Posterior) | Longus Colli, Longus Capitis | Isolation | 4-way neck machine | Advanced | Upper | Static | Machine | 1. Adjust 4-way neck machine seat height for proper forehead pad alignment 2. Sit upright with back against seat pad and position forehead against pad 3. Grasp handles for stability and engage core muscles 4. Apply forward pressure into pad without allowing head to move 5. Hold maximum voluntary isometric contraction for 5-10 seconds 6. Gradually release tension and return to neutral position 7. Rest 30-60 seconds between isometric holds | 1. Isometric neck training reduces kinematic responses during collisions through muscle pre-activation 2. For athletes with neck flexion strength less than 275N, concussion risk increases significantly 3. Progress from submaximal holds (50-70% MVC) to maximal effort holds (90-100% MVC) 4. Incorporate 4-way machine training for flexion, extension, and lateral flexion in single session 5. Advanced athletes can perform 3-5 sets of 10-second maximal holds per direction | 1.

28. | LYING NECK CURL (PLATE-LOADED) | Sternocleidomastoid, Scalenes (Anterior, Middle, Posterior) | Longus Colli, Longus Capitis | Isolation | Weight plate (2.5-10 lbs), flat bench, towel | Advanced | Upper | Pull | Free Weight | 1. Lie supine on flat bench with head extending off edge of bench 2. Place folded towel on forehead and position weight plate on top of towel 3. Hold plate in place with both hands for stability 4. Begin with neck in neutral alignment (head level with bench) 5. Slowly flex neck forward, bringing chin toward chest 6. Stop when comfortable stretch is felt in posterior neck muscles 7. Return to neutral start position under control, resisting plate weight | 1. Lying position targets sternocleidomastoid through full range of cervical flexion 2. Begin with very light weight (2.5-5 lbs) and progress gradually to prevent strain 3. Use 25+ repetitions due to slow-twitch fiber dominance in neck musculature 4. Eccentric phase (lowering) should take 3-4 seconds for maximum muscle activation 5. Advanced athletes can progress to 10-15 lbs for strength development | 1. Conley MS, Stone MH, Nimmons M, et al.

## ROTATOR CUFF EXERCISES (2 exercises)

29. | CABLE INTERNAL ROTATION | Subscapularis | Pectoralis Major (Clavicular Head), Latissimus Dorsi, Teres Major | Isolation | Cable machine with D-handle attachment | Beginner | Upper | Pull | Cables | 1. Set cable pulley to elbow height and attach D-handle 2. Stand perpendicular to cable machine with working arm closer to pulley 3. Grasp handle with working arm, elbow bent 90 degrees at side 4. Position forearm perpendicular to torso (neutral start position) 5. Rotate arm inward, bringing forearm across front of torso 6. Stop when forearm reaches midline or slightly past 7. Return to neutral start position under control, resisting cable tension | 1. Keep elbow tucked tightly against side of torso throughout movement to isolate subscapularis 2. Use light weight (5-15 lbs) to maintain control and prevent compensation from larger muscles 3. Internal rotation exercises support shoulder health but should not be overemphasized 4. Perform 12-15 repetitions for 2-3 sets to build rotator cuff endurance | 1. Reinold MM, Wilk KE, Fleisig GS, et al. (2004).

30. | CABLE EXTERNAL ROTATION | Infraspinatus, Teres Minor | Posterior Deltoid, Supraspinatus | Isolation | Cable machine with D-handle attachment | Beginner | Upper | Pull | Cables | 1. Set cable pulley to elbow height and attach D-handle 2. Stand perpendicular to cable machine with working arm farther from pulley 3. Grasp handle with working arm, elbow bent 90 degrees at side 4. Position forearm across front of torso (internal rotation start position) 5. Rotate arm outward, bringing forearm away from torso 6. Stop when forearm is perpendicular to torso or slightly past 7. Return to start position under control, resisting cable tension | 1. Sidelying external rotation produces 62-67% MVIC for infraspinatus and teres minor 2. Keep elbow tucked tightly against side (can use towel roll between elbow and ribs) 3. Cable provides constant tension advantage over free weights for rotator cuff training 4. External rotation exercises are gold-standard rehab exercise with high infraspinatus activation 5. Use 2:1 ratio of external to internal rotation volume to prevent shoulder imbalances | 1.
