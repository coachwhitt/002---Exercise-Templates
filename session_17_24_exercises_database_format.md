Complete 10-15 reps with strict form (2-3 second eccentric, 1 second concentric) | 1. Incline angle (45-60°) creates continuous tension and optimal loading for long head throughout ROM 2. Keep upper arms perpendicular to floor and stationary - all movement from elbow joint only (isolation) 3. EZ-bar angled grip reduces wrist and forearm strain vs straight bar while maintaining high EMG activation 4. Lower bar behind head (skull crusher style) or to forehead depending on shoulder mobility 5. Full ROM with deep stretch at bottom position critical for maximizing long head activation (76% MVIC overhead) | ACE-Commissioned Study: Overhead extensions ranked 4th with ~76% muscle activation; Effect of shoulder position on triceps heads activity. PubMed; Science Says: Best and Worst Triceps Exercises. The Barbell; Electromyographic analysis of triceps. U Wisconsin. Overhead/incline positions superior to lying flat for long head emphasis | American Football, Baseball, Basketball, Volleyball, Swimming, Tennis, Bodybuilding, CrossFit, Powerlifting, Boxing, MMA, Wrestling | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Kneeling Cable Triceps Extension | Triceps Brachii (long head emphasis, lateral head, medial head) | Core Stabilizers (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques), Latissimus Dorsi (stabilizer) | Isolation | Cable Machine with Rope or Straight Bar | Beginner | Upper | Push | Cables | 1. Attach rope or straight bar to high cable pulley, kneel on mat facing cable machine 2. Grab rope/bar with overhand grip, step/shuffle back until arms overhead with slight forward lean 3. Position elbows beside head with bent position (90-110°), keep upper arms stationary 4. Extend elbows to press rope/bar forward and down until arms fully extended in front of body 5. Squeeze triceps at full extension, pause briefly at lockout position 6. Return with control to starting position, allowing elbows to bend while keeping upper arms fixed 7. Complete 12-15 reps maintaining strict form and kneeling position throughout | 1. Kneeling position eliminates momentum and leg drive, forcing pure triceps isolation without compensation 2. Constant cable tension throughout ROM provides superior muscle loading vs free weight resistance curves 3. Rope attachment allows hands to separate at bottom (pronation) for enhanced triceps contraction 4. Core must resist cable pulling force - engage abs and obliques throughout movement for anti-flexion stability 5. Experiment with cable height: high pulley emphasizes long head, mid pulley targets all three heads equally | Surface electromyography for assessing triceps activities. ResearchGate; Muscle Fatigue in Three Heads of Triceps Brachii. PMC; ACE-Commissioned Study on Triceps Exercise Rankings. ACE ProSource; Science Says: Best and Worst Triceps Exercises. The Barbell.

| One Arm Dumbbell Row | Latissimus Dorsi (unilateral emphasis), Rhomboideus Major and Minor, Trapezius (middle fibers), Teres Major, Posterior Deltoid | External Obliques (contralateral - anti-rotation), Internal Obliques (ipsilateral), Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis, Erector Spinae (ipsilateral stabilization), Core musculature | Compound | Dumbbell, Flat Bench | Beginner | Upper | Pull | Free Weight | 1. Place left knee and left hand on flat bench for support, right foot on floor for stability 2. Hold dumbbell in right hand with neutral grip, arm hanging straight beneath shoulder 3. Position torso parallel to floor, maintain neutral spine with core engaged 4. Pull dumbbell upward toward hip/lower ribcage, leading with elbow not hand 5. Continue pulling until elbow reaches or passes torso, squeeze shoulder blade toward spine 6. Pause briefly at top, then lower dumbbell with control to full arm extension 7. Complete 10-15 reps maintaining strict form, then switch sides | 1. Bench support reduces spinal loading vs unsupported variations, allows heavier loads and greater focus 2. Pull elbow back and up, not just up - emphasizes lats over traps for optimal back development 3. Allow slight torso rotation at top of movement for maximal lat contraction (not excessive) 4. External obliques highly activated to resist rotation - excellent anti-rotation core exercise 5. Greater ROM than barbell rows - descend until full lat stretch achieved for enhanced muscle lengthening | Saeterbakken AH et al (2011). Comparison of muscle activity and 1-RM strength. J Sports Sci 29(5):533-538; Fenwick CMJ et al (2009). Comparison of different rowing exercises. J Strength Cond Res 23(2):350-358; Saeterbakken AH & Fimland MS (2013).

| Reverse-Grip Lat Pulldown | Latissimus Dorsi (lower lat fibers emphasis), Biceps Brachii (significantly increased), Brachialis (high activation), Teres Major | Brachioradialis, Trapezius (middle fibers - lower vs pronated), Trapezius (lower fibers), Posterior Deltoid (lower vs pronated), Rhomboideus Major and Minor, Forearm flexors, Core musculature | Compound | Lat Pulldown Machine, Straight Bar | Intermediate | Upper | Pull | Cables | 1. Sit at lat pulldown machine, adjust thigh pad to secure legs, feet flat on floor 2. Grip straight bar with supinated (underhand) grip, hands shoulder-width or slightly wider 3. Lean back slightly (10-15°), engage core, initiate pull by depressing shoulder blades 4. Pull bar down toward upper chest in smooth arc, leading with elbows 5. Continue pulling until bar reaches collarbone/upper chest, squeeze shoulder blades together 6. Pause briefly at bottom, then extend arms with control to starting position 7. Complete 10-15 reps maintaining constant tension on lats throughout | 1. Supinated grip provides biomechanical advantage for biceps brachii - allows heavier loads than pronated grip 2. Lower lat fibers emphasized more than pronated variations - excellent for "V-taper" development 3. Pull bar to upper chest, not behind neck - safer for shoulder joint, maintains better lat activation 4. Lead with elbows, not hands - visualize elbows pulling down and back for proper muscle recruitment 5. May allow greater ROM at bottom of pull vs pronated grip due to supinated biomechanics | Signorile JF et al (2002). Comparative EMG investigation of muscle utilization patterns.
