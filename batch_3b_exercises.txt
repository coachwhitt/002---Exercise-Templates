KEY SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS:

CALF TRAINING:
- Knee angle = primary determinant of gastrocnemius vs soleus activation
- Standing/extended knee = gastrocnemius dominant (Type II fast-twitch)
- Seated/flexed knee = soleus dominant (Type I slow-twitch)
- Equipment type less important than knee position
- Both variations required for complete triceps surae development
- Gastrocnemius: 8-12 reps, heavy loads
- Soleus: 15-30 reps, moderate loads, longer TUT

CHEST TRAINING:
- Bench angle significantly affects pectoralis major head recruitment
- Incline 30-45° = clavicular (upper) head emphasis
- Flat = balanced clavicular + sternocostal development
- Decline 15-30° = sternocostal (lower) head emphasis
- Dumbbells increase stabilizer activation (anterior deltoid, biceps) vs barbell
- Dumbbells allow greater ROM (descend below chest, adduction at top)
- Machines reduce stabilizer activation, allow higher loads safely
- Free weights superior for functional strength, machines superior for isolation

BICEPS TRAINING:
- Shoulder position determines biceps head recruitment
- Arm forward/shoulder flexion (spider curl) = short head emphasis
- Arm behind body/shoulder extension (incline curl) = long head emphasis
- Spider curl provides constant tension throughout ROM due to vertical arm position
- Fixed elbow position eliminates momentum and shoulder involvement
- Peak contraction occurs at 90° elbow flexion
