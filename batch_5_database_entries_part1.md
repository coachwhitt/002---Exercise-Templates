**Low Cable Crossover**

**Primary:** Pectoralis Major - Sternal Head, Pectoralis Major - Clavicular Head

**Secondary:** Anterior Deltoid, Pectoralis Minor, Serratus Anterior

**Type:** Isolation

**Equipment:** Cable Machine (Dual Pulleys)

**Instructions:** Stand centered between cables with handles at shoulder height. Step forward with tension in cables. Position arms out to sides with elbows slightly bent (10-15°), palms forward. Maintain athletic stance with one foot forward. Engage core, keep chest lifted. Pull handles down and across body in smooth arc, bringing them together in front of lower chest. Squeeze chest at peak contraction. Return slowly with control.

**Cues:** Maintain constant cable tension throughout full ROM; Focus on mind-muscle connection visualizing pec fibers contracting; Experiment with pulley heights (high-to-low emphasizes lower pec, low-to-high emphasizes upper pec); Avoid forward lean or momentum; Rotate palms inward at bottom and hold peak contraction 1-2 seconds

**Pec Deck**

**Primary:** Pectoralis Major - Sternal Head, Pectoralis Major - Clavicular Head

**Secondary:** Anterior Deltoid, Biceps Brachii (Short Head - stabilizer)

**Type:** Isolation

**Equipment:** Pec Deck Machine

**Instructions:** Adjust seat so handles are at chest level when seated. Sit upright with back firmly against pad, feet flat. Place forearms against padded lever arms with elbows bent at 90°. Grip handles lightly - push through forearms, not hands. Start with arms wide, feeling comfortable chest stretch. Exhale as you bring pads together in front of chest using smooth, controlled motion. Squeeze chest when pads meet at center. Inhale as you slowly return to start.

**Cues:** Minimize triceps involvement by pushing through elbows rather than hands; Maintain scapular stability - avoid excessive forward protraction; Pause 1-2 seconds at peak contraction; Control eccentric phase with 2-3 second tempo; Partial reps at contracted position enhance metabolic stress

**Pec Deck Fly**

**Primary:** Pectoralis Major - Sternal Head, Pectoralis Major - Clavicular Head

**Secondary:** Anterior Deltoid, Coracobrachialis

**Type:** Isolation

**Equipment:** Pec Deck Machine (Straight Arm Handles)

**Instructions:** Adjust seat so handles align with mid-chest when arms extended. Sit with back firmly against pad, feet flat. Grasp handles with palms facing inward, arms extended with slight elbow bend (10-20°). Start with arms wide, feeling gentle chest stretch. Keep core engaged, upright posture. Bring handles together in wide arcing motion, focusing on chest doing work. Squeeze pectorals at peak contraction when handles meet. Return slowly with control.

**Cues:** Maintain same elbow angle throughout - this is a fly not a press; Imagine hugging large tree trunk for proper movement pattern; Control scapular position - avoid excessive protraction or winging; Utilize 3-1-2 tempo (3s eccentric, 1s pause, 2s concentric) for hypertrophy; Keep shoulders depressed (down, away from ears) to reduce anterior deltoid dominance
