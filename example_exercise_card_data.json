  "instructionsBeginners": [
    "Lie flat on bench with eyes directly under the bar",
    "Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder width with palms facing forward",
    "Unrack the bar with straight arms and position it over your mid-chest",
    "Lower the bar with control to your mid-chest, keeping elbows at 45-degree angle",
    "Press the bar back up to the starting position until arms are fully extended",
    "Maintain 5-point contact (head, shoulders, glutes on bench; feet flat on floor) throughout"
  ],
  "coachingPoints": [
    "Maintain scapular retraction (shoulder blades squeezed together) throughout the entire movement",
    "Initiate the press with leg drive through the floor for maximum power transfer",
    "Bar path should be slightly diagonal toward your face, not perfectly vertical",
    "Control the eccentric (lowering) phase for 2-3 seconds to maximize muscle tension",
    "Keep wrists stacked directly over elbows to prevent wrist strain and maintain optimal force transfer"
