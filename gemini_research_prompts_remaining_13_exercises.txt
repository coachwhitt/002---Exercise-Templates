## SAVE FILES AS:

- **Batch 2:** `batch_supplementary_olympic_lifts_7_exercises_research.md`
- **Batch 3:** `batch_supplementary_kettlebell_suspension_6_exercises_research.md`

These will combine with the already-completed `batch_supplementary_6_exercises_research.md` (Ab-Cycle, Box Jumps, Broad Jumps, Squat Jumps, Superman, Superman-Hold) to give us all 19 exercises.

---

## QUALITY CHECKLIST:

For each exercise, verify:
- ✅ 3-4 peer-reviewed scientific references with DOIs/URLs
- ✅ EMG data included (% MVIC or relative activation)
- ✅ 5-7 beginner steps (clear, progressive)
- ✅ 5 advanced key points (biomechanical insights, not just tips)
- ✅ 10-12 sports tags (specific sports, not just "general fitness")
- ✅ Latin muscle names (e.g., "Gluteus Maximus" not "glutes")
- ✅ Specific equipment listed (e.g., "Barbell, Bumper Plates, Lifting Platform" not just "Barbell")

---

## EXPECTED RESEARCH TIME:

- **Batch 2 (Olympic Lifts):** 3-4 hours (complex movements, extensive literature)
- **Batch 3 (Kettlebell/Suspension):** 2-3 hours (moderate complexity)
- **Total Weekend Research:** 5-7 hours

## READY FOR TUESDAY SESSION:

Once both batches are researched and saved, we'll have:
- **Batch 1:** 6 exercises ✅ COMPLETE (Ab-Cycle, Box Jumps, Broad Jumps, Squat Jumps, Superman, Superman-Hold)
- **Batch 2:** 7 exercises (Olympic lifts & conditioning) - WEEKEND RESEARCH
- **Batch 3:** 6 exercises (Kettlebell, suspension, machine) - WEEKEND RESEARCH
- **TOTAL:** 19 exercises ready for database integration

Tuesday session will focus on:
1. Integrating all 19 exercises into database v3
2. Adding enhanced filtering columns
3. Adding video link columns
4. Regenerating complete database v3.1
