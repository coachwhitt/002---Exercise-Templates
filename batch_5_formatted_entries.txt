Extend other leg straight in line with bent knee. Arms at sides palms down for balance. Engage core to stabilize pelvis. Press through heel of bent leg to lift hips. Lift until body forms straight line shoulders to extended knee. Squeeze glutes at top, hold 1-2s. Lower with control, complete all reps before switching sides. | Gluteus maximus to hamstring ratio higher in single-leg bridges (111.3%) vs bilateral (59.2%); Focus on anti-rotation stability - hips rise/fall without tilting or rotating; Keep non-working leg actively engaged and aligned with working thigh; Maximize glute activation achieving full hip extension without compensatory lumbar hyperextension; Progress by elevating working foot, adding resistance, or performing with pause/isometric hold at peak | Lehecka et al.

| Deadlift | Erector Spinae, Gluteus Maximus, Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius, Rectus Femoris), Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus) | Trapezius, Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Forearm Flexors, Core Stabilizers | Compound | Barbell, Weight Plates | Advanced | Lower | Pull | Free Weight | Stand feet hip-width, barbell over mid-foot. Bend at hips and knees to grip bar just outside legs. Shoulders directly over or slightly ahead of bar. Flatten back by pulling chest up, engaging lats. Take deep breath, brace core. Drive through heels to lift bar close to body. Extend hips and knees simultaneously, stand straight shoulders back. Lower by pushing hips back first, then bend knees once bar passes them. | Erector spinae and quadriceps show greater activation than glutes and biceps femoris; Semitendinosus exhibits slightly greater activation than biceps femoris; Maintain thoracolumbar extension throughout - any flexion under load increases injury risk; 'Leg press the floor away' rather than 'pull the bar up' to optimize biomechanics; Romanian deadlift shifts activation toward hamstrings (lower erector spinae, higher biceps femoris/semitendinosus) | Martín-Fuentes et al. (2020) PLOS ONE 15(2):e0229507 DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0229507; McAllister et al. (2014) J Strength Cond Res 28(6):1573-1580 DOI:10.1519/JSC.0000000000000302; Camara et al.

| Leg Curl | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris Long/Short Head, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus) | Gastrocnemius, Popliteus | Isolation | Leg Curl Machine | Beginner | Lower | Pull | Fixed Resistance | Adjust machine so pad rests on back of lower legs just above heels. Position on machine according to variant (lying/seated/standing). Grip handles for stability. Start legs fully extended (avoid hyperextension). Engage core, keep hips pressed against pad. Curl heels toward glutes bending at knees. Squeeze hamstrings at fully contracted position. Slowly return to start with control, maintain tension throughout. | Mean hamstring activation 48.78% MVIC (moderate intensity); Most exercises show 6-26% higher semitendinosus vs biceps femoris, but supine leg curls preferentially activate biceps femoris; Point toes toward shins (dorsiflexion) to reduce gastrocnemius involvement, maximize hamstring activation; Avoid lifting hips off pad during lying leg curls - indicates weight too heavy; Eccentric emphasis (4-5s lowering) significantly enhances hamstring hypertrophy and strength | Bourne et al.

| Lying Alternating Leg Curl | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus) - Unilateral | Gastrocnemius, Gluteus Maximus | Isolation | Lying Leg Curl Machine | Intermediate | Lower | Pull | Fixed Resistance | Lie face down, pad positioned just above heels. Adjust so knees align with pivot. Grip handles, press hips firmly against pad. Start both legs extended. Curl one heel toward glute bending at knee, keep other leg straight. Squeeze hamstring at top. Lower that leg with control to start. Immediately curl opposite leg, alternating legs each repetition. | Alternating unilateral work identifies and corrects strength imbalances between legs; Maintain strict pelvic stability - avoid hip rotation or lifting one side of pelvis; Non-working leg remains actively extended against pad for stability; Use controlled tempo both phases (2s up, 3s down); Allows slightly heavier loads per leg vs simultaneous bilateral curls | Tsaklis et al. (2015) PLOS ONE 10(3):e0245838 DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0245838; Bourne et al. (2017) Sports Med 48(2):251-267 DOI:10.1007/s40279-017-0796-x; Schoenfeld et al.

| Lying Leg Curl | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris Long/Short Head, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus) | Gastrocnemius, Popliteus, Gracilis | Isolation | Lying Leg Curl Machine | Beginner | Lower | Pull | Fixed Resistance | Lie face down, knees just off bench edge. Position pad on back of lower legs just above heels. Align knees with machine pivot. Grip handles, keep hips pressed firmly against bench throughout. Start legs fully extended (slight knee bend to protect joint). Curl both heels toward glutes flexing at knees. Squeeze hamstrings hard at 90° or greater flexion. Lower weight slowly to start, maintain hamstring tension. | Lying leg curls preferentially activate biceps femoris over semitendinosus (uncommon among hamstring exercises); Keep ankles dorsiflexed (toes toward shins) to minimize gastrocnemius contribution; Resist urge to lift hips off pad - indicates excessive weight, reduces hamstring isolation; Peak EMG during muscle-tendon unit shortening phase (concentric); Supine position reduces lumbar stress vs standing or kneeling variations | Ebben (2009) Int J Sports Physiol Perform 4(1):84-96 DOI:10.1123/ijspp.4.1.84; Bourne et al.

| Lying Single-Leg Curl | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus) - Unilateral | Gastrocnemius, Gluteus Maximus, Erector Spinae | Isolation | Lying Leg Curl Machine | Intermediate | Lower | Pull | Fixed Resistance | Lie face down, pad positioned just above heels. Ensure knees align with machine pivot. Grip handles, press hips firmly against bench. Keep one leg extended and inactive while working other leg. Curl one heel toward glute bending at knee. Focus on squeezing hamstring of working leg at peak contraction. Lower leg with control to start. Complete all reps one side before switching to other leg. | Unilateral training reveals and corrects bilateral strength deficits (common in athletes); Non-working leg remains extended but relaxed - do not actively press into pad; Single-leg increases core stabilization demands to prevent torso rotation; Work weaker side first to ensure full neurological resources; Use 10-15% less load than bilateral to maintain proper form and full ROM | McCurdy et al. (2005) J Strength Cond Res 19(1):9-15 DOI:10.1519/14013.1; Tsaklis et al. (2015) PLOS ONE 10(3):e0245838 DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0245838; Bourne et al.

| Seated Leg Curl | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris Long/Short Head, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus) | Gastrocnemius, Popliteus | Isolation | Seated Leg Curl Machine | Beginner | Lower | Pull | Fixed Resistance | Sit in machine, adjust back pad so knees align with pivot. Position lower pad against back of calves just above heels. Place thigh pad securely over thighs to anchor legs. Grip handles on sides of seat. Start legs extended straight out front. Curl heels down and back toward seat bending at knees. Squeeze hamstrings hard at fully contracted position (typically 90+ degrees knee flexion). Slowly extend legs back to start with control. | Seated position pre-stretches hamstrings by placing hips in flexion, potentially increasing muscle activation; Thigh pad stabilization allows heavier loads vs lying variations; Minimize hip extension during curl - movement isolated to knee flexion; Dorsiflex ankles (pull toes toward shins) to reduce calf involvement; Seated recruits similar hamstring activation as lying curls but with reduced lumbar stress | Mohamed et al. (2002) Isokinetics Exercise Sci 10(4):193-199 DOI:10.3233/IES-2002-0109; Ebben (2009) Int J Sports Physiol Perform 4(1):84-96 DOI:10.1123/ijspp.4.1.84; Bourne et al.

Stand feet hip-width, core engaged. Step forward and at 45° angle (diagonally) with one leg. Plant front foot firmly, lower body bending both knees. Descend until front thigh parallel to ground, back knee just above floor. Keep torso upright, core braced throughout. Drive through front heel to return to start. Alternate legs or complete all reps one side before switching. | Diagonal lunges increase adductor and gluteus medius demand vs forward lunges; Diagonal trajectory enhances frontal plane stability - critical for sport performance; Maintain vertical shin alignment on front leg to optimize quadriceps loading; Drive explosively through front heel during concentric phase for power development; Multi-planar movement pattern transfers exceptionally well to change-of-direction athleticism | Muyor et al.

Feet shoulder-width, toes slightly outward. Squat down, reach behind to grip barbell overhand. Engage core, lift chest, keep back straight. Drive through heels, stand up by extending knees and hips. Stand fully erect at top, shoulders back. Lower bar to floor with control by bending knees and hips. Maintain upright torso throughout - bar tracks close behind legs. | EMG studies show significantly lower erector spinae and hamstring activation vs front/back squats; Barbell position behind body increases quadriceps loading while reducing spinal stress; Hack squats provide superior knee and spinal stabilization vs traditional squat variations; Keep weight distributed mid-foot to heels - avoid rising onto toes; Old-school exercise excellent for building quadriceps without lumbar fatigue | Gullett et al.

| Barbell Reverse Lunge | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius, Rectus Femoris), Gluteus Maximus | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus), Gluteus Medius, Adductor Magnus, Erector Spinae, Core Stabilizers | Compound | Barbell, Squat Rack | Intermediate | Lower | Push | Free Weight | Position barbell across upper back in high bar position. Stand feet hip-width, core engaged, chest up. Step backward with one leg, landing on ball of foot. Lower body bending both knees until front thigh parallel to ground. Keep torso upright throughout movement. Back knee should lower toward floor, stopping just above it. Drive through front heel to push back to start. Bring back leg forward to return to standing, then repeat with other leg. | Reverse lunges reduce anterior knee shear forces vs forward lunges - excellent for knee health; Stepping backward shifts more loading toward gluteus maximus vs forward lunges; Stationary front leg position allows better balance control, enabling heavier loads; Maintain slight forward torso lean (10-15°) to optimize posterior chain recruitment; Eccentric emphasis on descent phase maximizes muscle damage stimulus for hypertrophy | Cronin et al.

| Barbell Side Lunge | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius, Rectus Femoris), Gluteus Maximus, Gluteus Medius, Adductor Magnus/Longus/Brevis | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus), Erector Spinae, Core Stabilizers | Compound | Barbell, Squat Rack | Intermediate | Lower | Push | Free Weight | Position barbell across upper back in high bar position. Stand feet hip-width, core braced. Take large step directly to side with one leg (2-3 feet). Keep stepping leg's foot pointing forward (not turned out). Bend knee of stepping leg while keeping opposite leg straight. Lower hips down and back as if sitting into chair on that side. Descend until working thigh approximately parallel to ground. Drive through heel of bent leg to return to start. | Side lunges create significant frontal plane loading - critical for injury prevention in multi-directional sports; Adductors and gluteus medius work extensively to control lateral motion; Keep non-working leg fully extended with foot flat on ground throughout movement; Avoid excessive forward torso lean - maintain upright posture to maximize quadriceps and glute engagement; This exercise addresses often-neglected frontal plane of motion | Myer et al.

| Barbell Split Squat | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius, Rectus Femoris), Gluteus Maximus | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus), Gluteus Medius, Adductor Magnus, Erector Spinae, Core Stabilizers | Compound | Barbell, Squat Rack | Advanced | Lower | Push | Free Weight | Position barbell across upper back in high bar position. Take large step forward with one leg (staggered stance) approximately 2-3 feet. Position rear foot on ball of foot with heel elevated. Keep both feet pointing forward, maintain hip-width spacing between feet. Lower body straight down by bending both knees. Descend until front thigh parallel to ground, back knee nearly touches floor. Keep torso upright, chest lifted throughout. Drive through front heel to return to start. | Split squats provide stable base vs lunges, enabling heavier loads and greater muscle stimulus; Front leg performs approximately 70-80% of work while rear leg provides stability; Maintain vertical shin angle on front leg - adjust step length if knee travels excessively forward; Elevated rear heel increases quadriceps activation on front leg; Progress to Bulgarian split squats (rear foot elevated) for enhanced ROM and difficulty | McCurdy et al.

| Barbell Squat | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius, Rectus Femoris), Gluteus Maximus, Erector Spinae | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus), Adductor Magnus, Core Stabilizers, Calves (Gastrocnemius, Soleus) | Compound | Barbell, Squat Rack | Beginner | Lower | Push | Free Weight | Position barbell on squat rack at upper chest height. Step under bar, position on upper traps/rear deltoids (high bar) or lower on rear delts (low bar). Grip bar slightly wider than shoulder-width. Unrack bar, step back, feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out. Take deep breath, brace core, keep chest up. Initiate descent by bending hips and knees simultaneously. Lower until thighs parallel to ground or slightly below (hip crease below knee). Drive through heels to stand back up, keep knees aligned with toes throughout. | Front squats show highest vastus lateralis EMG activity, but back squats allow greater absolute loads; Muscle activation peaks at 90° knee flexion for all three quadriceps muscles; Maintain thoracic extension throughout - thoracic rounding increases injury risk and reduces force transmission; 'Spread the floor' by driving knees outward to activate hip external rotators and increase stability; Bar path should be vertical - any forward drift indicates mobility limitations or improper weight distribution | Schoenfeld (2010) J Strength Cond Res 24(12):3497-3506 DOI:10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bac2d7; Gullett et al.

| Barbell Step-Up | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius, Rectus Femoris), Gluteus Maximus | Gluteus Medius, Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus), Adductor Magnus, Erector Spinae, Core Stabilizers | Compound | Barbell, Squat Rack, Box or Bench | Advanced | Lower | Push | Free Weight | Position barbell across upper back in high bar position. Stand facing box/bench that brings thigh to parallel (or slightly above) when foot on it. Place one foot entirely on elevated surface with entire sole in contact. Keep opposite foot on ground to begin. Drive through heel of elevated foot to step up onto box. Bring trailing leg up to meet working leg, standing fully on box. Step down with control, leading with same leg that stepped up. Complete all reps one side before switching, or alternate legs each rep. | Vastus lateralis and medialis show highest EMG activity during step-ups; Step-ups classified as very high glute activation exercise (>60% MVIC) but actual activation comparable to squats/lunges; Minimize push-off from trailing leg - elevated leg should perform 90%+ of work; Maintain upright torso position - excessive forward lean recruits more hamstring than quadriceps; Box height significantly affects muscle activation: higher boxes = more glute, lower boxes = more quadriceps | Muyor et al.

| Barbell Walking Lunge | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius, Rectus Femoris), Gluteus Maximus | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus), Gluteus Medius, Adductor Magnus, Erector Spinae, Core Stabilizers, Calves | Compound | Barbell, Squat Rack | Advanced | Lower | Push | Free Weight | Position barbell across upper back in high bar position. Stand feet hip-width, core engaged. Take large step forward with one leg (2-3 feet). Lower body bending both knees until front thigh parallel to ground. Keep torso upright throughout movement. Drive through front heel, bring back leg forward to step into next lunge. Immediately step forward with opposite leg, continue walking pattern. Maintain continuous movement without pausing between reps. | Walking lunges increase balance and stabilization demands vs stationary lunges; Continuous forward momentum creates greater eccentric loading on quadriceps and glutes; Maintain consistent stride length for all reps - fatigue often causes shortened steps; Focus on vertical torso movement rather than horizontal - imagine moving between two parallel walls; This dynamic variation has superior transfer to sport-specific movement patterns | Farrokhi et al.

Engage core, maintain upright posture. Step forward and at 45° angle (diagonally) with one leg. Plant front foot firmly, toes pointing forward. Lower body bending both knees until front thigh parallel to ground. Keep back knee just above floor without touching. Drive through front heel to push back to start. Alternate legs or complete all reps one side before switching. | Diagonal lunges incorporate frontal and sagittal plane movement simultaneously; 45° angle increases adductor and gluteus medius activation vs forward lunges; Maintain square hips (avoid rotation) throughout movement to maximize stability demands; Hands position affects difficulty: hands on hips (easier), arms extended forward (moderate), hands behind head (harder); Multi-planar pattern directly transfers to change-of-direction movements in sports | Muyor et al.
