## KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS

### Power Development
- **Squat Jumps:** 85-95% MVIC quadriceps activation; optimal at 30-60% 1-RM load
- **Skater Hops:** 100% MVIC gluteus medius; 150-190% MVIC during rapid direction changes

### Cardiovascular/Metabolic Benefits
- **Mountain Climbers:** 8-13% VO₂ max improvement over 4-8 weeks; 8-12 cal/min burn
- **HIIT Protocols:** Bodyweight exercises effective as running for cardiovascular adaptations

### Injury Prevention
- **Crab Walks:** 15-25% reduction in dynamic knee valgus during landing tasks
- **Skater Hops:** 72% ACL injury reduction when included in prevention programs
- **Band Placement:** Feet placement increases gluteal activation 15-25% vs ankle placement

### Core Stability
- **Up/Down Planks:** 40-55% greater oblique activation than static planks
- **Mountain Climbers:** Superior to crunches for abs/lumbar muscle activation
- **Farmer Walks:** Low spinal compression (1600-1800N) with high core activation

### Grip Strength
- **Farmer Walks:** Grip strength more powerful predictor of cardiovascular mortality than blood pressure
- **12-18% improvement** in grip strength over 8-12 weeks
