Squat Jumps,"Quadriceps Femoris (Rectus Femoris; Vastus Lateralis; Vastus Medialis; Vastus Intermedius); Gluteus Maximus; Gastrocnemius","Soleus; Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris; Semitendinosus; Semimembranosus); Erector Spinae; Rectus Abdominis",Compound,Bodyweight,Intermediate,Lower,Explosive,Plyometric,"Quads_Hamstrings_Glutes; Explosive_Power; Full_Lower_Body","1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly outward. 2. Lower into quarter-to-half squat position (knees at 90-120° angle), keeping chest up and weight on midfoot. 3. Pause briefly in bottom position to eliminate stretch-shortening cycle. 4. Explosively extend through ankles, knees, and hips simultaneously while swinging arms overhead. 5. Drive through ground with maximum force to achieve vertical height. 6. Land softly on midfoot with slight knee flexion (20-30°) to absorb impact. 7. Reset to starting position and repeat for desired repetitions.","1. Arm Drive Maximization: Aggressively swing arms from low position to full overhead extension during takeoff to add 10-15% jump height through momentum transfer. 2. Triple Extension Focus: Achieve complete ankle, knee, and hip extension at takeoff for maximum power output. 3. Landing Mechanics: Land with hip-knee-ankle alignment to distribute forces evenly and protect ACL; avoid knee valgus collapse inward. 4. Pause Elimination vs Continuous: For pure power, pause 2-3 seconds between reps; for conditioning, minimize ground contact (<0.5s) to maintain SSC benefits. 5. Load Progression: Once proficient, add 10-30% bodyweight via dumbbells, weight vest, or barbell for strength-speed development.","Dragasevic D et al. (2021).

Stand on right leg with slight knee flexion (20-30°) and athletic posture. 2. Push off explosively with right leg, propelling body laterally to left side. 3. Land on left foot with knee and hip flexion to absorb impact (30-45° knee flexion). 4. Stabilize briefly on left leg (0.5-1 second) maintaining balance and knee tracking over toes. 5. Immediately push off left leg explosively, bounding back to right side. 6. Continue alternating sides in controlled lateral bounds for desired repetitions (6-10 per side). 7. Focus on frontal plane movement only (pure side-to-side, no forward progression).","1. Landing Mechanics Priority: Land with hip-knee-ankle alignment maintaining knee tracking over second toe; prevent dynamic knee valgus which increases ACL injury risk 2.5x. 2. Gluteal Loading Emphasis: Focus on hip hinge pattern and gluteal engagement during landing rather than quad-dominant absorption; gluteus maximus should activate 45%+ MVIC pre-landing. 3. Single-Leg Stabilization: Hold landing position 0.5-1 second to develop frontal plane stability before explosive push-off; gluteus medius contracts at 100% MVIC. 4. Distance Progression: Begin with 3-4 foot lateral bounds; progress to 5-8 feet as frontal plane control improves. 5. Arm Drive Coordination: Swing arms across body in skating motion to enhance lateral momentum.","PMC 7727409. Gluteus medius activation highest during single-limb hurdle hops (100% MVIC); PMC 4556293.

Stand 6-12 inches away from box with feet hip-width apart. 2. Lower into quarter squat position with arms back. 3. Explosively swing arms forward and up while extending hips, knees, and ankles simultaneously. 4. Drive through entire foot to propel body upward onto box. 5. Land softly on box with both feet simultaneously, knees slightly bent. 6. Stand fully upright on box achieving full hip and knee extension. 7. Step down carefully one foot at a time, reset position, and repeat.","1. Triple Extension Focus: Achieve complete ankle, knee, and hip extension during takeoff for maximum power output and height. 2. Arm Drive Coordination: Aggressive arm swing adds 10-15% jump height through momentum transfer. 3. Landing Mechanics: Land with soft knees maintaining hip-knee-ankle alignment; avoid knee valgus collapse. 4. Box Height Progression: Start 12-18 inch box; progress to 24-36 inches after mastering technique. 5. Step-Down vs Jump-Down: Always step down to preserve eccentric loading for subsequent reps.","Muyor et al. (2020).
