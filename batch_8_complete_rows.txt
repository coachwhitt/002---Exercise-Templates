Kneeling Cable Triceps Extension | Triceps brachii (long head emphasis, lateral head, medial head) | Core stabilizers (rectus abdominis, obliques), latissimus dorsi (stabilizer) | Isolation | Cable machine with rope or straight bar | Beginner to Intermediate | Upper | Extension | Cables | 1. Attach rope or bar to high cable pulley, kneel on mat facing machine 2. Grab rope/bar overhand grip, step/shuffle back until arms overhead with slight forward lean 3. Position elbows beside head with bent position (90-110 degrees), keep upper arms stationary 4. Extend elbows to press rope/bar forward and down until arms fully extended in front 5. Squeeze triceps at full extension, pause briefly at lockout 6. Return with control to start, allow elbows to bend while keeping upper arms fixed 7. Complete 12-15 reps maintaining strict form and kneeling position throughout | 1. Kneeling eliminates momentum and leg drive, forcing pure triceps isolation 2. Constant cable tension throughout ROM provides superior loading vs free weights 3. Rope attachment allows hands to separate at bottom (pronation) for enhanced contraction 4. Core must resist cable pulling force - engage abs and obliques 5. Experiment with cable height: high pulley emphasizes long head, mid pulley targets all heads equally | Surface EMG triceps brachii activities review. ResearchGate; Muscle Fatigue Three Heads Triceps.
