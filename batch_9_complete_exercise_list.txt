==============================================================================
RESEARCH FOCUS AREAS:
==============================================================================

TRICEPS:
✓ EMG studies comparing lying vs overhead vs pushdown triceps activation
✓ Long head activation differences (overhead = maximal stretch/activation)
✓ Lateral vs medial head recruitment patterns
✓ Elbow positioning and shoulder angle effects
✓ Single-arm vs bilateral activation patterns

NECK:
✓ Cervical spine safety protocols and progression guidelines
✓ Contact sport injury prevention research (concussion reduction)
✓ Sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, trapezius activation patterns
✓ Isometric vs dynamic neck strengthening effectiveness
✓ Manual resistance vs machine training comparisons

ROTATOR CUFF:
✓ Subscapularis isolation techniques (internal rotation)
✓ Infraspinatus/teres minor activation (external rotation)
✓ Shoulder impingement prevention protocols
✓ Overhead athlete injury prevention research
✓ Optimal shoulder positioning for rotator cuff isolation

==============================================================================
FINAL DATABASE IMPACT:
==============================================================================

Current Database: 355 exercises
Batch 9 Addition: +30 exercises
New Database Total: 385 exercises ⚠️ (5 over target)

CORRECTION NEEDED:
Target was 380 exercises total
Current plan: 355 + 30 = 385 exercises
Overage: 5 exercises

OPTIONS:
1. Proceed with 385 exercises (5 bonus exercises for enhanced coverage)
2. Remove 5 least-essential exercises from the 30-exercise batch
3. Adjust target to 385 exercises (original goal was "~380" not exactly 380)

RECOMMENDATION: Option 3 - Proceed with 385 exercises
Rationale: Neck coverage gap critical (only 4 current → 10 with batch = minimal coverage)
All 30 exercises add strategic value to database completeness
