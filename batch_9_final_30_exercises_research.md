# TRICEPS EXERCISES (22 exercises)

## SECTION 1: LYING TRICEPS VARIATIONS (7 exercises)

### 1. LYING CABLE TRICEPS EXTENSION

**Primary Muscles:** Triceps Brachii (Long Head, Lateral Head, Medial Head)
**Secondary Muscles:** Anconeus
**Type:** Isolation
**Equipment:** Cable machine with straight bar or rope attachment
**Level:** Intermediate
**Body Region:** Upper
**Movement Pattern:** Push
**Modality:** Cables

**Steps for Beginners:**
1. Set cable pulley to lowest position and attach straight bar or rope handle
2. Lie supine on bench positioned 2-3 feet from cable station with head toward pulley
3. Grasp attachment with arms extended overhead, elbows bent at 90 degrees
4. Keep upper arms stationary and perpendicular to floor throughout movement
5. Extend elbows by contracting triceps until arms are fully straightened
6. Lower weight under control, allowing elbows to bend to 90 degrees
7. Maintain consistent tension on cable throughout entire range of motion

**Advanced Key Points:**
1. Keep upper arms locked in vertical position to isolate triceps and prevent shoulder recruitment
2. Pause briefly at full elbow extension to maximize medial head activation
3. Use slow eccentric phase (3-4 seconds) to increase time under tension
4. Maintain constant cable tension by avoiding full relaxation at bottom position

2. Sit upright facing away from machine with back against seat pad
3. Position back of head against pad with neck in neutral alignment
4. Grasp handles for stability and engage core
5. Slowly extend neck backward, bringing head toward upper back
6. Stop when comfortable stretch is felt in anterior neck muscles
7. Return to neutral start position under control, resisting machine weight

**Advanced Key Points:**
1. Extension produces highest isometric force in neck musculature (approximately 429N in rugby players)
2. Use controlled range of motion - avoid hyperextension beyond comfortable limit
3. Begin with light weight (10-20 lbs) and focus on muscle activation over load
4. Maintain shoulder stability by keeping scapulae retracted throughout movement

### 25. LATERAL NECK FLEXION (MANUAL RESISTANCE)

**Primary Muscles:** Sternocleidomastoid (ipsilateral), Scalenes (ipsilateral - Anterior, Middle, Posterior)
**Secondary Muscles:** Splenius Capitis (contralateral), Levator Scapulae (ipsilateral)
**Type:** Isolation
**Equipment:** Bodyweight (manual resistance from hand)
**Level:** Intermediate
**Body Region:** Upper
**Movement Pattern:** Static
**Modality:** Bodyweight

**Steps for Beginners:**
1. Sit upright on bench or chair with neutral spine alignment
2. Place one hand against side of head above ear on same side
3. Apply moderate resistance with hand while neck remains in neutral position
4. Attempt to laterally flex neck toward shoulder while resisting with hand
5. Hold isometric contraction for 5-10 seconds without movement
6. Release tension gradually and return to neutral
7. Repeat on opposite side for balanced development

**Advanced Key Points:**
1. During lateral flexion, ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid acts as primary mover with highest activation
2. Ipsilateral scalenes support SCM movement, enhancing amplitude of lateral flexion
3. Begin with light manual resistance (30-40% of maximum voluntary contraction)
4. Progress to heavier resistance as neck strength and endurance improve
5. Avoid shoulder elevation during movement - isolate neck musculature
