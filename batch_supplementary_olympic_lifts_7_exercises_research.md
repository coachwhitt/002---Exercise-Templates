## 1. Clean (Power Clean)

| Attribute | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Exercise Name** | Clean (Power Clean) |
| **Primary Muscles** | Gluteus Maximus, Semitendinosus, Biceps Femoris, Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Erector Spinae, Trapezius (Upper and Middle) |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Gastrocnemius, Soleus, Deltoids (Anterior, Medial), Rhomboids, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Multifidus |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Barbell, Bumper Plates |
| **Level** | Advanced |
| **Body Region** | Full Body |
| **Movement** | Explosive |
| **Modality** | Free Weight |

#### Steps for Beginners

1.  **Starting Position:** Stand with feet hip-width apart, toes under the barbell. Squat down with chest up, and grip the bar with a hook grip slightly wider than your shoulders. Your back should be straight, hips lower than shoulders, and shoulders directly over or slightly in front of the bar.
2.  **First Pull (To Knees):** Initiate the lift by driving through your heels and extending your legs. The angle of your back should remain constant. Keep your arms straight and the bar close to your shins.
3.  **Transition (Scoop):** As the bar passes your knees, rebend your knees slightly and bring your torso to a more upright position. This "scoop" motion loads the hamstrings and glutes for the second pull.
4.  **Second Pull (Explosion):** Explosively extend your hips, knees, and ankles (triple extension). The movement should be powerful and fast, like a vertical jump. Shrug your shoulders and pull your body under the bar.
5.  **Catch:** As you drop under the bar, rotate your elbows forward and around the bar as quickly as possible. Receive the bar in a front squat position with the barbell resting on your anterior deltoids and clavicles. Your elbows should be high and pointing forward.
6.  **Recovery:** Drive up from the squat position to a full standing position.

#### Advanced Key Points

1.  **Maximize Triple Extension:** Focus on generating maximal power from the ankles, knees, and hips. The second pull is where the majority of the bar's upward velocity is generated. The hip extension should be violent and complete.
2.  **Barbell Trajectory:** Keep the bar as close to the body as possible throughout the entire lift. A bar path that loops out and away from the body is a common technique flaw that reduces efficiency and power.
3.  **Elbow Speed in the Catch:** The speed at which you can get your elbows around and under the bar is critical for a successful catch. This requires significant shoulder mobility and aggressive action.
4.  **Torso Angle:** Maintain a consistent back angle during the first pull. A common error is for the hips to rise faster than the shoulders, which turns the lift into a stiff-legged deadlift and reduces power.
5.  **The "Hook" Grip:** Utilize a hook grip (thumb wrapped around the bar, with fingers over the thumb) to maintain a secure hold during the high-velocity second pull. This prevents the bar from slipping.

## 2. Clean and Jerk

| Attribute | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Exercise Name** | Clean and Jerk |
| **Primary Muscles** | Gluteus Maximus, Quadriceps, Erector Spinae, Deltoids, Triceps Brachii, Trapezius |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Hamstrings, Gastrocnemius, Soleus, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Serratus Anterior, Pectoralis Major (Clavicular Head) |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Barbell, Bumper Plates |
| **Level** | Advanced |
| **Body Region** | Full Body |
| **Movement** | Explosive |
| **Modality** | Free Weight |

#### Steps for Beginners

1.  **The Clean:** Perform a full "Clean" movement as described in the Power Clean section, but receive the bar in a full, deep front squat.
2.  **Front Squat Recovery:** From the bottom of the squat, drive through the heels to stand up to a fully erect position, with the bar resting on the anterior deltoids.
3.  **The Dip (for Jerk):** With feet hip-width apart, initiate the jerk with a shallow, controlled dip by bending at the knees. Keep your torso upright and elbows high.
4.  **The Drive (for Jerk):** Explosively drive upward with your legs, extending your hips and knees to propel the barbell off your shoulders.
5.  **The Catch (Split Jerk):** As the bar leaves the shoulders, quickly split your legs, one forward and one backward, into a lunge position. Simultaneously, press your body under the bar, locking your elbows out overhead.
6.  **Recovery:** Once stable, bring your front foot halfway back, then your back foot to meet it. Stand with feet together, bar held securely overhead.
7.  **Lowering the Bar:** Carefully lower the bar to the shoulders, and then to the floor.

#### Advanced Key Points

1.  **Jerk Dip and Drive:** The dip should be shallow and straight down. The drive must be vertical and powerful, using leg power to create upward momentum on the bar. The arms are for pressing *under*, not pressing *up*.
2.  **Footwork in the Split Jerk:** The split should be long and stable, with the front shin vertical and the back knee slightly bent. This provides a solid base of support to receive the weight.
3.  **Head Position:** During the jerk drive, the head must move back out of the way of the bar path, and then come forward ("through the window") once the bar has cleared the chin to ensure a stable overhead position.
4.  **Breathing and Bracing:** Take a deep breath and brace the core before the clean, and again before the jerk. This intra-abdominal pressure is crucial for spinal stability under heavy loads.
5.  **Timing and Rhythm:** The Clean and Jerk is a rhythmic lift. The transition from the clean's recovery to the jerk's dip should be seamless but controlled, allowing for a reset and proper setup.

## 3. Hang Clean

| Attribute | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Exercise Name** | Hang Clean |
| **Primary Muscles** | Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus), Trapezius (Upper, Middle), Erector Spinae, Deltoids |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Quadriceps, Gastrocnemius, Rhomboids, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Barbell, Bumper Plates |
| **Level** | Advanced |
| **Body Region** | Full Body |
| **Movement** | Explosive |
| **Modality** | Free Weight |

#### Steps for Beginners

1.  **Starting Position:** Deadlift the barbell to a standing position. Hinge at the hips and slightly bend the knees to lower the bar to the "hang" position, typically just above the knees. Your back must remain straight and your chest up.
2.  **The Jump:** From the hang position, explosively extend your hips, knees, and ankles (triple extension). This should be a powerful vertical jumping motion.
3.  **Shrug and Pull:** As your body reaches full extension, shrug your shoulders powerfully and use the momentum to pull your body under the bar. Your arms remain straight for as long as possible.
4.  **The Catch:** As in the power clean, quickly rotate your elbows forward and around the bar. Receive the bar in a front squat position on your anterior deltoids.
5.  **Recovery:** Drive up from the squat to a full standing position.
6.  **Lowering:** Safely lower the bar back to the hang position or to the floor.

#### Advanced Key Points

1.  **Loading the Hamstrings:** The hang position emphasizes the eccentric loading of the hamstrings and glutes. Focus on feeling the tension build in these muscles as you lower the bar before initiating the explosive pull.
2.  **No Arm Pull:** The power comes from the hips, not the arms. The arms should act as ropes, guiding the bar upward only after full hip and leg extension is achieved. Pulling early with the arms is a major power leak.
3.  **Aggressive Hip Extension:** The hang clean forces a more pronounced and violent hip extension to generate vertical momentum since there is no "first pull" from the floor.
4.  **Balance and Foot Pressure:** Maintain balance over the mid-foot. As you initiate the pull, the pressure should shift from the mid-foot towards the ball of the foot, culminating in the "jump."
5.  **Varying Hang Positions:** Advanced athletes can vary the starting hang position (e.g., high-hang/hip level, mid-thigh, or below the knee) to target specific phases of the pull and develop power from different joint angles.

## 4. Snatch (Power Snatch)

| Attribute | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Exercise Name** | Snatch (Power Snatch) |
| **Primary Muscles** | Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings, Quadriceps, Erector Spinae, Deltoids, Trapezius |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Gastrocnemius, Rhomboids, Serratus Anterior, Triceps Brachii, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Barbell, Bumper Plates |
| **Level** | Advanced |
| **Body Region** | Full Body |
| **Movement** | Explosive |
| **Modality** | Free Weight |

#### Steps for Beginners

1.  **Starting Position:** Feet hip-width apart. Grip the barbell with a very wide grip (snatch grip). Squat down with a straight back, chest up, and hips low.
2.  **First Pull:** Drive with the legs to lift the bar from the floor, keeping the arms straight and the bar close to the shins. The back angle remains constant until the bar passes the knees.
3.  **Second Pull:** As the bar clears the knees, explosively extend the hips, knees, and ankles. The bar should make contact with the hip crease, propelling it vertically.
4.  **Third Pull (Turnover):** After full extension, shrug your shoulders and actively pull your body under the bar. Keep the bar close to your torso.
5.  **Catch:** Receive the bar overhead with arms locked and in a partial squat position. The head should be "through the window" (slightly forward of the arms) for stability.
6.  **Recovery:** Stand up from the squat to a full upright position with the bar held securely overhead.

#### Advanced Key Points

1.  **Grip Width:** The ideal snatch grip width allows the bar to rest in the hip crease when standing tall. This is crucial for maximizing power transfer during the second pull.
2.  **Overhead Stability:** The snatch demands exceptional shoulder and thoracic spine mobility and stability to support the weight overhead. Work on overhead squats and shoulder stabilization drills is essential.
3.  **Speed Under the Bar:** The snatch is often described as "jumping and landing in a squat." The speed at which you can transition from extending upwards to pulling downwards under the bar determines success with heavy loads.
4.  **Active Shoulders in Catch:** In the overhead catch position, the shoulders should be actively pushed up towards the ears, creating a stable "bone-on-bone" support structure.
5.  **Full Extension:** Do not cut the second pull short. Ensure you reach full, violent triple extension before initiating the pull under the bar. A premature pull under the bar will significantly limit the height of the bar.

## 5. Thruster

| Attribute | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Exercise Name** | Thruster |
| **Primary Muscles** | Gluteus Maximus, Quadriceps, Deltoids (Anterior, Medial), Triceps Brachii |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Hamstrings, Erector Spinae, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Trapezius, Serratus Anterior |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Barbell, Dumbbells, or Kettlebells |
| **Level** | Intermediate/Advanced |
| **Body Region** | Full Body |
| **Movement** | Explosive |
| **Modality** | Free Weight |

#### Steps for Beginners

1.  **Rack Position:** Hold a barbell in the front rack position, resting on your anterior deltoids with a loose fingertip grip. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart.
2.  **The Squat:** Initiate the movement by sending your hips back and down into a full front squat. Keep your chest up, back straight, and elbows high.
3.  **The Drive:** From the bottom of the squat, explosively drive upwards through your heels.
4.  **Hip Extension and Press:** As you approach the top of the squat, use the powerful momentum from your hip extension to begin pressing the barbell overhead.
5.  **The Press:** Continue the press until your arms are fully locked out overhead. Your head should move slightly back and then forward "through the window" to allow a straight bar path.
6.  **The Descent:** In a controlled manner, lower the bar back to the front rack position and immediately descend into the next squat. The movement should be fluid and continuous.

#### Advanced Key Points

1.  **Energy Transfer:** The key is a seamless transfer of energy from the lower body to the upper body. The press should be initiated by the hip drive, not as a separate movement after the squat is completed.
2.  **Breathing Rhythm:** Develop a consistent breathing pattern. Typically, you inhale on the way down and exhale forcefully as you drive the weight overhead. For multiple reps, you may hold your breath briefly during the transition.
3.  **Elbow Position:** Keeping the elbows high in the front squat is crucial for maintaining an upright torso and providing a solid "shelf" for the bar. Dropping the elbows will cause the chest to fall and the bar to shift forward.
4.  **Push Press, Not a Strict Press:** The overhead portion is a push press, meaning it is driven by leg momentum. Avoid turning it into a strict press, which is far less efficient and will limit the weight you can use.
5.  **Shallow Dip Re-acceleration:** For very heavy thrusters or in a fatigued state, a slight re-bend of the knees (a shallow dip) as the bar comes off the shoulders can help to re-accelerate it overhead, similar to a jerk.

## 6. Kettlebell Swings

| Attribute | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Exercise Name** | Kettlebell Swings (Two-Handed) |
| **Primary Muscles** | Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings, Erector Spinae |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Latissimus Dorsi, Deltoids (Anterior), Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Quadriceps, Forearm Flexors (Grip) |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Kettlebell |
| **Level** | Intermediate |
| **Body Region** | Full Body |
| **Movement** | Explosive |
| **Modality** | Free Weight |

#### Steps for Beginners

1.  **Setup:** Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Place the kettlebell about a foot in front of you on the floor.
2.  **The Hike:** Hinge at your hips, keeping your back flat, and grip the kettlebell with both hands. "Hike" the kettlebell back between your legs, high into the groin area.
3.  **The Swing:** Explosively drive your hips forward, squeezing your glutes and straightening your legs. This hip thrust propels the kettlebell forward and up.
4.  **The Float:** Allow the kettlebell to float up to chest height. Your arms should be relaxed and act like ropes; do not lift the kettlebell with your shoulders.
5.  **The Downswing:** As the kettlebell begins to descend, let gravity do the work. Guide it back between your legs as you hinge at the hips, ready for the next rep.
6.  **Breathing:** Exhale sharply at the top of the swing; inhale as you hinge back.

#### Advanced Key Points

1.  **It's a Hinge, Not a Squat:** The primary movement is a horizontal projection of the hips (hip hinge), not a vertical squat. The knees should bend, but only to facilitate the hinge.
2.  **Power Breathing:** The sharp exhalation at the top of the swing (the "tssss" sound) helps to brace the core and amplify power production.
3.  **Lat Engagement:** Before the hike, "pack" your shoulders down and back to engage your lats. This keeps the kettlebell connected to your body and protects your lower back.
4.  **The "Plank" at the Top:** At the apex of the swing, your body should form a rigid, vertical plank. Glutes and abs should be contracted hard. Avoid leaning back or hyper-extending the spine.
5.  **Patience on the Downswing:** Don't fight the kettlebell on its way down. Let it fall and only hinge your hips back at the last moment before it would make contact with your body. This "game of chicken" maximizes the stretch-shortening cycle in the hamstrings.

## 7. Prowler Push

| Attribute | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Exercise Name** | Prowler Push (Sled Push) |
| **Primary Muscles** | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris), Gluteus Maximus, Gastrocnemius, Soleus |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Hamstrings, Erector Spinae, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Deltoids (Anterior), Pectoralis Major, Triceps Brachii (as stabilizers) |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Prowler / Sled |
| **Level** | Beginner to Advanced (scalable by load and speed) |
| **Body Region** | Full Body |
| **Movement** | Push |
| **Modality** | Other (Weighted Sled) |

#### Steps for Beginners

1.  **Setup:** Load the prowler with an appropriate weight. Start light to master the form.
2.  **Grip and Stance:** Stand behind the prowler and grip the vertical push-handles. Your arms can be bent or nearly straight. Lean your body forward at a 45-degree angle.
3.  **Initiate the Push:** Step forward and drive with your legs, pushing the sled. Your body should form a straight line from head to heels.
4.  **Driving Steps:** Continue driving the sled forward with powerful, deliberate steps. Focus on pushing the ground away behind you.
5.  **Maintain Posture:** Keep your core braced and your back flat throughout the movement. Avoid letting your hips sag or your back round.

#### Advanced Key Points

1.  **Body Angle:** The angle of your body dictates the focus. A more upright posture (high-handle push) is better for speed and acceleration work. A lower body angle (low-handle push) increases the load on the legs and is better for strength development.
2.  **Forceful Leg Drive:** The movement is a leg drive, not an arm push. Your arms and torso should act as a rigid structure to transfer the force generated by your legs into the sled.
3.  **Stride Length and Frequency:** For strength, use powerful, shorter strides. For speed and conditioning, focus on longer, more rapid strides, emphasizing high knee drive.
4.  **Maximal Intent:** Regardless of the weight, push with maximal intent and aggression on every step. The prowler is an excellent tool for developing concentric power without eccentric loading.
5.  **Breathing:** Find a rhythmic breathing pattern that matches your stride cadence. For heavy, slow pushes, you may take a breath between steps. For lighter, faster pushes, breathing will be more rapid.
