Cable Front Raise | Deltoideus (anterior head - clavicular portion) | Deltoideus (lateral head), pectoralis major (clavicular head), serratus anterior, trapezius (upper fibers), core stabilizers (anti-extension) | Isolation | Cable machine with straight bar, rope, or single-handle attachments | Beginner to Intermediate | Upper | Isolation | Cables | 1. Set cable pulley to lowest position, attach straight bar or rope, stand facing away from machine with feet shoulder-width apart 2. Grip bar with pronated grip (palms down) or rope with neutral grip, position hands shoulder-width apart, start with cable behind legs creating tension 3. Step forward 1-2 feet from machine to create starting tension, arms extended with slight elbow bend (10-15°), bar positioned against front of thighs 4. Engage core muscles, establish neutral spine with shoulders retracted and depressed, chest up position to resist forward cable pull 5. Raise bar or rope forward and upward along arc in sagittal plane, maintaining slight elbow bend and parallel arm position throughout 6. Continue raising until bar reaches eye level or shoulder height (90° shoulder flexion), maintaining constant tension from cable throughout ascent 7. Pause briefly at top (1 second), slowly lower bar back to starting position with controlled eccentric (2-3 seconds), resisting cable tension throughout descent for 12-15 repetitions |  | Campos, Y.
