RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS:
======================

For TRICEPS exercises:
- Focus on EMG studies comparing lying vs overhead vs pushdown variations
- Highlight long head activation differences (overhead = maximal long head stretch)
- Document elbow positioning and shoulder angle effects on muscle recruitment
- Include sports requiring triceps strength (throwing, punching, pressing movements)

For NECK exercises:
- Emphasize cervical spine safety and progression protocols
- Reference contact sport injury prevention research
- Document muscle activation: sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, trapezius
- Sports focus: American Football, Rugby, Wrestling, MMA, Boxing, Hockey

For ROTATOR CUFF exercises:
- Focus on subscapularis (internal rotation) and infraspinatus/teres minor (external rotation)
- Include shoulder health and injury prevention research
- Document optimal shoulder positioning for isolation
- Sports focus: Baseball, Tennis, Swimming, Volleyball, Overhead Athletes

SCIENTIFIC REFERENCE STANDARDS:
===============================
- Minimum 3-4 peer-reviewed studies per exercise
- Prefer EMG (electromyography) studies showing muscle activation patterns
- Include DOI or PubMed URL for each reference
- Format: Author(s) (Year). Title. Journal Volume(Issue):Pages. DOI/URL

IMPORTANT NOTES:
================
- Use specific Latin muscle names (e.g., "Triceps Brachii - Long Head, Lateral Head, Medial Head")
- Differentiate similar exercises clearly (e.g., lying vs overhead triceps extensions target different heads)
- Ensure all 30 exercises are researched comprehensively
- Maintain consistent formatting across all exercises
- Focus on practical application for CoachWhitt's athlete clientele

Please research all 30 exercises using the framework above.
