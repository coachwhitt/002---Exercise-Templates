| Incline Twisting Dumbbell Fly | Pectoralis Major (clavicular head, medial fibers) | Anterior Deltoid, Biceps Brachii (long head), Serratus Anterior | Isolation | Dumbbells, Incline Bench (30°) | Advanced | Upper | Push | Free Weight | 1. Set bench to 30° incline 2. Lie back with dumbbells pressed up, start with neutral grip (palms facing) 3. Maintain slight elbow bend (15-20°) throughout movement 4. Lower dumbbells in wide arc while rotating to pronated grip (palms forward) 5. Pause at stretch position with pronated grip 6. Return along arc while rotating back to neutral grip 7. At top, dumbbells nearly touching with neutral grip | 1. Rotation from neutral to pronated adds internal rotation component during stretch phase 2. Twisting motion enhances upper pec and medial fiber recruitment vs static grip 3. Greater motor control demand than static grip fly variations 4. Requires 15-20% lighter loads than static fly due to rotational complexity 5. Superior neuromuscular coordination and proprioceptive development | Welsch EA et al. (2005). EMG of pectoralis variations. J Strength Cond Res 19(2):449-452 | Saeterbakken AH et al. (2017). Grip effects on activation.
