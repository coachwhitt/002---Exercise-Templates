## SESSION 1 NOTES

**Completed:** 10 CHEST exercises with full enhanced column structure (CORRECTED)

**Video Links Status:**
- ExRx: ✅ All 10 exercises have working links
- JEFIT: ✅ All 10 exercises have working links
- CoachWhitt: [TBD] Placeholder for future custom videos

**Corrections Applied (Post-Review):**
1. Removed redundant "Joint" column (16 columns total, down from 17)
2. Expanded Modality abbreviations to full text (Free Weight, Cables, Fixed Resistance, Bodyweight)
3. Removed FitSW Video column (GIF links returned access denied errors, final count: 15 columns)

**Next Steps (Sessions 2-5):**
- Session 2: Complete BACK (10 exercises) + SHOULDERS (10 exercises)
- Session 3: Complete ARMS (Biceps/Triceps - 20 exercises)
- Session 4: Complete LEGS (Quads/Hamstrings/Glutes - 20 exercises)
- Session 5: Complete CORE, CALVES, FOREARMS, NECK + remaining variations

**Questions for Review:**
1. FitSW alternative - Should we replace with another video source, or keep as N/A?
2. Level classifications - Origym CSV vs existing database sometimes differ (e.g., Barbell Bench Press = Intermediate in Origym, unlisted in current database)
3. Some Origym exercises very similar to existing (e.g., "Flat Bench Press" vs "Barbell Bench Press") - merge or keep separate?

---

**Database Statistics:**
- Total exercises planned: ~370 (100 existing + 270 Origym)
