## SESSION 1 NOTES

**Completed:** 10 CHEST exercises with full enhanced column structure
**Video Links Status:**
- ExRx: ✅ All 10 exercises have working links
- JEFIT: ✅ All 10 exercises have working links
- FitSW: ❌ Does not provide direct exercise URLs (research confirmed)
- CoachWhitt: [TBD] Placeholder for future custom videos

**Next Steps (Sessions 2-5):**
- Session 2: Complete BACK (10 exercises) + SHOULDERS (10 exercises)
- Session 3: Complete ARMS (Biceps/Triceps - 20 exercises)
- Session 4: Complete LEGS (Quads/Hamstrings/Glutes - 20 exercises)
- Session 5: Complete CORE, CALVES, FOREARMS, NECK + remaining variations

**Questions for Review:**
1. FitSW alternative - Should we replace with another video source, or keep as N/A?
2. Level classifications - Origym CSV vs existing database sometimes differ (e.g., Barbell Bench Press = Intermediate in Origym, unlisted in current database)
3. Some Origym exercises very similar to existing (e.g., "Flat Bench Press" vs "Barbell Bench Press") - merge or keep separate?

---

**Database Statistics:**
- Total exercises planned: ~370 (100 existing + 270 Origym)
- Session 1 complete: 10/370 (2.7%)
- Estimated completion: Session 5 (100% coverage)
