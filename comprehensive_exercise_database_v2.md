| Dumbbell Step-Up | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis), Gluteus Maximus | Gluteus Medius, Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris), Adductors, Gastrocnemius/Soleus | Compound | Dumbbells (pair), elevated platform or box (12-24 inches) | Beginner | Lower | Push | Free Weight | 1. Stand facing elevated box/platform (12-20 inches), holding dumbbells at sides 2. Place right foot entirely on box surface 3. Push through right heel to lift body onto box 4. Bring left foot up to meet right foot on box 5. Step down with left foot first, then right foot 6. Complete all reps on right leg, then switch to left | 1. Box height selection: Knee angle at 90° when foot is on box = optimal quad activation 2. Drive mechanics: Push through heel of elevated foot—avoid pushing off trailing foot 3. Torso position: Slight forward lean (10-15°) increases glute engagement 4. Eccentric control: 2-3 second descent when stepping down—eccentric quad overload 5. Advanced variation: Lateral step-up increases glute medius activation vs standard forward step-up | Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during step-up exercises. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841.

Stand upright holding dumbbells at sides, feet hip-width apart 2. Step forward with right leg approximately 2-3 feet 3. Lower body by bending both knees to 90 degrees 4. Push through right heel and bring left leg forward into next lunge 5. Continue alternating legs while moving forward 6. Maintain upright torso throughout movement | 1. Step length: 2.5-3 feet stride length = optimal quad/glute balance—shorter emphasizes quads, longer emphasizes glutes 2. Continuous motion: Unlike stationary lunges, maintain forward momentum—builds dynamic stability 3. Knee tracking: Front knee tracks over 2nd-3rd toe throughout movement—never collapse inward 4. Core engagement: Anti-rotation demand high—brace core to prevent torso twisting 5. Breathing pattern: Inhale during step/descent, exhale during drive/next step | Stastny P et al. (2015). EMG in walking lunge. J Hum Kinet 49:59-67; Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during forward lunge. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841; Macadam P et al. (2021). Lunges vs back squats.

Stand upright with feet hip-width apart, hands on hips 2. Step forward with right leg approximately 2-3 feet 3. Lower body by bending both knees until front thigh is parallel to floor 4. Keep front knee aligned over ankle, back knee hovers above floor 5. Push through front heel to return to starting position 6. Repeat on opposite leg, alternating sides | 1. Progression pathway: Bodyweight → holding light dumbbells → barbell front rack → barbell back rack 2. Knee position: Front knee stays behind toes—if knee passes toes, increase step length 3. Torso angle: Upright (vertical) = quad emphasis; forward lean (15-20°) = glute/hamstring emphasis 4. Tempo manipulation: Pause 2 seconds at bottom to eliminate momentum and maximize quad activation 5. Balance challenge: Narrow step width (single track) increases balance demand vs wide step (dual track) | Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during forward lunge. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841.

Position barbell across upper back (high bar position), feet shoulder-width apart 2. Take wide lateral step to right (2-3 feet), keeping left leg straight 3. Shift weight to right leg, bend right knee and hip 4. Lower hips back and down until right thigh is parallel to floor 5. Push through right heel to return to center starting position 6. Repeat on opposite side, alternating | 1. Stance width: 2.5-3 feet lateral step = optimal adductor stretch and glute medius activation 2. Straight leg tension: Non-working leg remains straight with adductor actively lengthening 3. Hip hinge pattern: Sit back into hip—avoid forward knee drift over toes 4. Bar position: High bar (upper traps) = more upright; low bar (rear delts) = more forward lean 5. Foot angle: Working leg foot points forward or slightly outward (5-10°)—never inward | Distefano LJ et al. (2009). Gluteal muscle activation. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 39(12):532-540; Muyor JM et al.

Bring left foot up to meet right foot on box 5. Step down laterally with left foot first, then right foot 6. Complete all reps on right leg, then switch sides | 1. Lateral emphasis: Approach box from side (not front) to maximize frontal plane movement and glute medius activation 2. Drive mechanics: Push through heel of elevated foot—minimize push from trailing foot 3. Hip stability: Focus on preventing hip drop on non-elevated side—activates glute medius maximally 4. Box height: 15-20 inches = optimal for most athletes; higher box = greater glute activation 5. Progression: Bodyweight → dumbbells → barbell → barbell with chains/bands for accommodating resistance | Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during step-up exercises. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841.

Stand with feet together, hands clasped at chest or on hips 2. Take wide lateral step to right (2-3 feet), keeping left leg straight 3. Shift weight to right leg, bend right knee and push hips back 4. Lower hips until right thigh is parallel to floor, left leg remains straight 5. Push through right heel to return to center standing position 6. Repeat on opposite side, alternating | 1. Bodyweight foundation: Master this pattern before adding load (goblet DB → barbell) 2. Straight leg role: Non-working leg adductor eccentrically loads, then concentrically contracts to return 3. Hip hinge cue: "Sit back into a chair" on working leg—not forward knee bend 4. Knee tracking: Working knee tracks over 2nd-3rd toe—prevent knee valgus (collapse) 5. Progression: Add pause at bottom (2-3 sec) → pulse reps → goblet hold → barbell | Distefano LJ et al. (2009).

Sit in leg press machine, back flat against padded backrest 2. Place feet on platform shoulder-width apart, mid-foot position 3. Release safety handles, lower platform by bending knees to 90 degrees 4. Push through heels to extend legs, stopping just before lockout 5. Control descent back to 90-degree knee angle 6. Re-engage safety handles when set is complete | 1. Foot placement variation: High on platform = glute/hamstring emphasis; low = quad emphasis; wide = adductor involvement 2. Depth control: 90° knee angle = standard; deeper (100-110°) = greater quad activation but higher knee stress 3. Lower back safety: Maintain lumbar curve against pad—avoid "butt wink" (posterior pelvic tilt) at deep angles 4. Tempo manipulation: 3-second eccentric, 1-second pause, explosive concentric maximizes hypertrophy 5. Single-leg variation: Unilateral leg press identifies left/right imbalances and increases stability demand | Lorenzetti S et al. (2020). Evaluation of lower limb muscles' EMG during leg press.

Lie supine on horizontal leg press machine, back flat against pad 2. Place feet on platform shoulder-width apart, mid-foot position 3. Release safety handles, bend knees to lower platform to 90-degree knee angle 4. Push through heels to extend legs, stopping just before lockout 5. Control descent back to 90-degree starting position 6. Re-engage safety handles after completing set | 1. Horizontal advantage: Lying position allows deeper knee flexion without lumbar flexion risk vs 45° leg press 2. Foot placement: Mid-platform = balanced; high = glute/hamstring; low = quad dominant 3. Lower back protection: Maintain natural lumbar curve—avoid tail tucking (posterior pelvic tilt) at bottom 4. Depth variation: 90° = standard; 100-110° = greater quad stretch and activation 5. Tempo strategy: 3-4 second eccentric maximizes quad hypertrophy; explosive concentric builds power | Lorenzetti S et al. (2020). EMG during leg press variants.

Position shoulders under padded supports of hack squat machine, back against pad 2. Place feet on platform shoulder-width apart, mid-foot position 3. Release safety handles, bend knees to lower until thighs parallel to platform 4. Keep back flat against pad throughout movement 5. Push through heels to extend legs, stopping just before lockout 6. Re-engage safety handles after completing set | 1. Quad isolation: Machine path eliminates balance demand—allows pure quad focus and heavier loading vs free squats 2. Spinal safety: Significantly lower erector spinae activation vs free weight squats—ideal for those with back issues 3. Foot placement: Low on platform = max quad; mid-platform = balanced; high = more glute/hamstring 4. Depth target: Full depth (thighs below parallel) maximizes vastus medialis activation 5. Tempo variation: Slow eccentric (3-4 sec) + pause (2 sec) + explosive concentric = hypertrophy protocol | Yavuz HU et al. (2015). EMG evaluation of squat variations.

Keep front knee aligned over ankle, back knee hovers above floor 5. Push through front heel to return to starting position 6. Repeat on opposite leg, alternating sides | 1. Knee safety: Reverse lunge reduces anterior knee shear vs forward lunge—ideal for knee issues 2. Stationary limb focus: Front leg drives movement—emphasize pushing floor away 3. Weight distribution: 70% front leg, 30% back leg—back leg primarily for balance 4. Torso position: Slight forward lean (10-15°) increases glute activation in front leg 5. Progression: Bodyweight → dumbbells at sides → dumbbells at shoulders → barbell → deficit (elevate front foot) | Boullosa D et al. (2024). The reverse lunge: EMG study. Applied Sciences 14(24):11480.

Set up barbell in landmine attachment or secure one end in corner 2. Stand perpendicular to barbell, hold free end with right hand at shoulder height 3. Take wide lateral step to right (2-3 feet), left leg remains straight 4. Shift weight to right leg, bend right knee and push hips back 5. Lower until right thigh parallel to floor, maintain barbell at shoulder 6. Push through right heel to return to center starting position 7. Complete all reps on right side, then switch | 1. Anti-rotation demand: Single-arm load creates massive rotational force—obliques and transverse abdominis work intensely 2. Core bracing: Engage core before each rep—resist rotation toward loaded side 3. Hip stability: Prevent hip drop on non-working side—activates glute medius maximally 4. Barbell path: Keep barbell close to body—farther away increases core demand exponentially 5. Progression: Light barbell (33 lbs) → standard (45 lbs) → loaded barbell → single-arm overhead variation | Saeterbakken AH et al. (2020). Kinematic and EMG comparison of unilateral squats.

Complete all reps on right side, then switch (hold DB in left hand, step left) | 1. Load placement: Dumbbell on same side as working leg = quad/glute focus; opposite side = greater core anti-rotation demand 2. Hip hinge pattern: Sit back into hip—avoid forward knee translation over toes 3. Straight leg tension: Non-working leg adductor eccentrically loads, then concentrically contracts 4. Core stability: Resist lateral flexion toward weighted side—obliques work isometrically 5. Progression: Light DB (10-15 lbs) → moderate (20-30 lbs) → heavy (35+ lbs) → goblet hold at chest → two DBs | Saeterbakken AH et al. (2020). Kinematic and EMG of unilateral squats.

Safety advantage: Can rerack at any point—useful for training to failure without spotter 3. Foot position: Can place feet forward of bar (impossible with free weight)—shifts emphasis to glutes/hamstrings 4. Biomechanical constraint: Fixed vertical path may not suit individual biomechanics—some lifters experience knee/hip discomfort 5. Use cases: Rehabilitation, beginner learning squat pattern, high-rep burnout sets, when training alone without spotter | Schick EE et al. (2010).

Adjust so knees align with pivot. Grip handles, press hips firmly against pad. Start both legs extended. Curl one heel toward glute bending at knee, keep other leg straight. Squeeze hamstring at top. Lower that leg with control to start. Immediately curl opposite leg, alternating legs each repetition. | Alternating unilateral work identifies and corrects strength imbalances between legs; Maintain strict pelvic stability - avoid hip rotation or lifting one side of pelvis; Non-working leg remains actively extended against pad for stability; Use controlled tempo both phases (2s up, 3s down); Allows slightly heavier loads per leg vs simultaneous bilateral curls | Tsaklis et al.

Take large step forward with one leg (staggered stance) approximately 2-3 feet. Position rear foot on ball of foot with heel elevated. Keep both feet pointing forward, maintain hip-width spacing between feet. Lower body straight down by bending both knees. Descend until front thigh parallel to ground, back knee nearly touches floor. Keep torso upright, chest lifted throughout. Drive through front heel to return to start. | Split squats provide stable base vs lunges, enabling heavier loads and greater muscle stimulus; Front leg performs approximately 70-80% of work while rear leg provides stability; Maintain vertical shin angle on front leg - adjust step length if knee travels excessively forward; Elevated rear heel increases quadriceps activation on front leg; Progress to Bulgarian split squats (rear foot elevated) for enhanced ROM and difficulty | McCurdy et al.

Step under bar, position on upper traps/rear deltoids (high bar) or lower on rear delts (low bar). Grip bar slightly wider than shoulder-width. Unrack bar, step back, feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out. Take deep breath, brace core, keep chest up. Initiate descent by bending hips and knees simultaneously. Lower until thighs parallel to ground or slightly below (hip crease below knee). Drive through heels to stand back up, keep knees aligned with toes throughout. | Front squats show highest vastus lateralis EMG activity, but back squats allow greater absolute loads; Muscle activation peaks at 90° knee flexion for all three quadriceps muscles; Maintain thoracic extension throughout - thoracic rounding increases injury risk and reduces force transmission; 'Spread the floor' by driving knees outward to activate hip external rotators and increase stability; Bar path should be vertical - any forward drift indicates mobility limitations or improper weight distribution | Schoenfeld (2010) J Strength Cond Res 24(12):3497-3506 DOI:10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bac2d7; Gullett et al.

Step down with control, leading with same leg that stepped up. Complete all reps one side before switching, or alternate legs each rep. | Vastus lateralis and medialis show highest EMG activity during step-ups; Step-ups classified as very high glute activation exercise (>60% MVIC) but actual activation comparable to squats/lunges; Minimize push-off from trailing leg - elevated leg should perform 90%+ of work; Maintain upright torso position - excessive forward lean recruits more hamstring than quadriceps; Box height significantly affects muscle activation: higher boxes = more glute, lower boxes = more quadriceps | Muyor et al.
