## EXERCISE 1: SQUAT JUMPS

| Column | Data |
|--------|------|
| **Exercise** | Squat Jumps |
| **Primary Muscles** | Quadriceps Femoris (Rectus Femoris, Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius); Gluteus Maximus; Gastrocnemius |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Soleus; Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus); Erector Spinae; Rectus Abdominis |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Bodyweight |
| **Level** | Intermediate |
| **Body Region** | Lower |
| **Movement** | Explosive |
| **Modality** | Plyometric |
| **Functional Groups** | Quads_Hamstrings_Glutes; Explosive_Power; Full_Lower_Body |
| **Steps for Beginners** | 1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly outward. 2. Lower into quarter-to-half squat position (knees at 90-120° angle), keeping chest up and weight on midfoot. 3. Pause briefly in bottom position to eliminate stretch-shortening cycle. 4. Explosively extend through ankles, knees, and hips simultaneously while swinging arms overhead. 5. Drive through ground with maximum force to achieve vertical height. 6. Land softly on midfoot with slight knee flexion (20-30°) to absorb impact. 7. Reset to starting position and repeat for desired repetitions. |
| **Advanced Key Points** | 1. Arm Drive Maximization: Aggressively swing arms from low position to full overhead extension during takeoff to add 10-15% jump height through momentum transfer. 2. Triple Extension Focus: Achieve complete ankle, knee, and hip extension at takeoff (think "punch the ground away") for maximum power output. 3. Landing Mechanics: Land with hip-knee-ankle alignment to distribute forces evenly and protect ACL; avoid knee valgus collapse inward. 4. Pause Elimination vs Continuous: For pure power, pause 2-3 seconds between reps; for conditioning, minimize ground contact (<0.5s) to maintain SSC benefits. 5. Load Progression: Once proficient, add 10-30% bodyweight via dumbbells, weight vest, or barbell for strength-speed development. |

## EXERCISE 2: MOUNTAIN CLIMBERS

| Column | Data |
|--------|------|
| **Exercise** | Mountain Climbers |
| **Primary Muscles** | Rectus Abdominis; Hip Flexors (Iliopsoas, Rectus Femoris); Deltoids (Anterior, Middle) |
| **Secondary Muscles** | External Obliques; Internal Obliques; Transverse Abdominis; Triceps Brachii; Quadriceps Femoris; Gluteus Maximus |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Bodyweight |
| **Level** | Beginner |
| **Body Region** | Full Body |
| **Movement** | Conditioning |
| **Modality** | Bodyweight |
| **Functional Groups** | Full_Core; Shoulders; Conditioning_Cardio |
| **Steps for Beginners** | 1. Start in high plank position with hands shoulder-width apart directly under shoulders, body forming straight line from head to heels. 2. Engage core by bracing abdominals as if preparing for punch to stomach. 3. Lift right foot off ground and drive right knee toward right elbow, keeping hips level. 4. Quickly return right foot to starting position while simultaneously driving left knee toward left elbow. 5. Continue alternating legs in controlled running motion, maintaining plank position throughout. 6. Keep shoulders stacked over wrists and hips square to floor (no rotation). 7. Perform for desired time duration (20-60 seconds) or repetition count (20-40 total reps). |
| **Advanced Key Points** | 1. Plank Integrity: Maintain neutral spine with head-spine-pelvis alignment; imagine balancing broomstick on back touching head, upper back, and tailbone simultaneously. 2. Anti-Rotation Emphasis: Drive knee toward same-side elbow (not center chest) to maximize oblique engagement and prevent trunk rotation. 3. Shoulder Stability: Keep shoulders packed down away from ears; if shoulders migrate forward past wrists, indicates scapular fatigue—stop and reset. 4. Tempo Variation: Slow tempo (2-second drives) for strength-endurance; explosive tempo for cardiovascular conditioning and HIIT protocols. 5. Breathing Pattern: Coordinate exhale with knee drive, inhale with leg extension to maintain core pressurization and prevent breath-holding. |

## EXERCISE 3: CRAB WALKS (LATERAL BAND WALKS)

| Column | Data |
|--------|------|
| **Exercise** | Crab Walks (Lateral Band Walks) |
| **Primary Muscles** | Gluteus Medius; Gluteus Maximus (Posterior Fibers); Tensor Fascia Latae |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Gluteus Minimus; Quadriceps Femoris; Adductors; External Obliques |
| **Type** | Isolation |
| **Equipment** | Resistance Band (Loop Band) |
| **Level** | Beginner |
| **Body Region** | Lower |
| **Movement** | Lunge |
| **Modality** | Fixed Resistance |
| **Functional Groups** | Glutes_Hips; Lateral_Movement; Injury_Prevention |
| **Steps for Beginners** | 1. Place resistance loop band around forefeet (not ankles) for optimal gluteal activation. 2. Stand with feet hip-width apart creating moderate tension on band. 3. Lower into quarter squat position (30-45° knee flexion) with chest up, weight on midfoot. 4. Keep toes pointing forward throughout movement (do not externally rotate feet). 5. Step laterally with right foot to create 30-50% band stretch. 6. Follow with left foot, maintaining constant tension on band (don't let feet come together). 7. Complete 10-20 steps in one direction, then reverse and walk back. |
| **Advanced Key Points** | 1. Band Placement Optimization: Position band around forefeet rather than ankles to create internal rotation torque that gluteals must counter, increasing activation 15-25% and minimizing TFL dominance. 2. Stance Width Consistency: Maintain band tension throughout entire set—never allow feet to come together or band to go slack. 3. Squat Depth Control: Too shallow reduces quad engagement; too deep (>60° knee flexion) shifts load from glutes to quadriceps dominance. 4. Foot Angle Discipline: Keep toes pointing forward to ensure gluteals work against internal rotation torque; externally rotating feet reduces gluteal demand. 5. Tempo Manipulation: Use slow controlled tempo (2-second step cadence) for strength; faster tempo for endurance and conditioning applications. |
| **Scientific Reference** | Lewis CL et al. (2019). Band placement around feet elicits 68-82% MVIC gluteal activation without increasing TFL compared to ankle/knee placement; Distefano LJ et al. (2009). Lateral band walks show gluteus medius 61% MVIC stance leg, 42% MVIC swing leg. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 39(7):532-540; Hip abductor strengthening reduces dynamic knee valgus 15-25% during landing tasks; Gender differences study showing women require feet placement for optimal activation |

## EXERCISE 4: UP/DOWN PLANK (PLANK TO FOREARM PLANK)

| Column | Data |
|--------|------|
| **Exercise** | Up/Down Plank (Plank to Forearm Plank) |
| **Primary Muscles** | Rectus Abdominis; Transverse Abdominis; External Obliques; Deltoids (Anterior, Middle) |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Internal Obliques; Erector Spinae; Triceps Brachii; Serratus Anterior; Gluteus Maximus; Quadriceps Femoris |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Bodyweight |
| **Level** | Intermediate |
| **Body Region** | Full Body |
| **Movement** | Conditioning |
| **Modality** | Bodyweight |
| **Functional Groups** | Full_Core; Shoulders; Anti_Rotation |
| **Steps for Beginners** | 1. Start in high plank position with hands shoulder-width apart under shoulders, body in straight line from head to heels. 2. Engage core by bracing abdominals and squeeze glutes to prevent lumbar hyperextension. 3. Lower right elbow to ground where right hand was positioned, then lower left elbow to forearm plank position. 4. Keep hips level and square to floor throughout transition (prevent rotation). 5. Press right hand into ground to return to hand position, then press left hand to return to high plank. 6. Maintain neutral spine and shoulder stability throughout entire movement. 7. Repeat for desired repetitions (8-12 full transitions) or time duration (30-60 seconds). |
| **Advanced Key Points** | 1. Neutral Spine Maintenance: Keep head-spine-pelvis alignment throughout transitions; imagine balancing glass of water on lower back that must not spill. 2. Anti-Rotation Control: Obliques contract 70-85% MVIC during transitions to prevent trunk rotation; focus on keeping hips square to floor. 3. Shoulder Packing: Maintain scapular depression (shoulders down away from ears) to prevent shoulder shrugging and ensure proper shoulder girdle stability. 4. Transition Tempo: Control descent to forearms over 2-3 seconds; explosive return to hands for power-endurance stimulus. 5. Breathing Discipline: Exhale during transitions to maintain intra-abdominal pressure and core stability rather than breath-holding which increases blood pressure. |
| **Scientific Reference** | PMC 11036226 (2024). Dynamic planks show 40-55% greater oblique activation than static planks; transverse abdominis thickness increases 28-35%; compressive forces low at 1600-1800N; Journal Clinical Diagnostic Research (2021). Modified planks increase upper rectus abdominis 65-78% MVIC, external oblique 70-85% MVIC; MDPI Applied Sciences (2023). Head flexion increases abdominal activation 12-18%; ACE (2014). Plank variations activate rectus abdominis 65-100% MVIC |

## EXERCISE 5: SKATER HOPS (LATERAL BOUNDS)

| Column | Data |
|--------|------|
| **Exercise** | Skater Hops (Lateral Bounds) |
| **Primary Muscles** | Gluteus Medius; Gluteus Maximus; Quadriceps Femoris |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus); Gastrocnemius; Soleus; Adductors; External Obliques; Vastus Lateralis |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Bodyweight |
| **Level** | Advanced |
| **Body Region** | Lower |
| **Movement** | Explosive |
| **Modality** | Plyometric |
| **Functional Groups** | Glutes_Hips; Explosive_Power; Lateral_Movement; Injury_Prevention |
| **Steps for Beginners** | 1. Stand on right leg with slight knee flexion (20-30°) and athletic posture. 2. Push off explosively with right leg, propelling body laterally to left side. 3. Land on left foot (midfoot landing) with knee and hip flexion to absorb impact (30-45° knee flexion). 4. Stabilize briefly on left leg (0.5-1 second) maintaining balance and knee tracking over toes. 5. Immediately push off left leg explosively, bounding back to right side. 6. Continue alternating sides in controlled lateral bounds for desired repetitions (6-10 per side). 7. Focus on frontal plane movement only (pure side-to-side, no forward progression). |
| **Advanced Key Points** | 1. Landing Mechanics Priority: Land with hip-knee-ankle alignment maintaining knee tracking over second toe; prevent dynamic knee valgus (inward collapse) which increases ACL injury risk 2.5x. 2. Gluteal Loading Emphasis: Focus on hip hinge pattern and gluteal engagement during landing rather than quad-dominant absorption; gluteus maximus should activate 45%+ MVIC pre-landing. 3. Single-Leg Stabilization: Hold landing position 0.5-1 second to develop frontal plane stability before explosive push-off; gluteus medius contracts at 100% MVIC during this phase. 4. Distance Progression: Begin with 3-4 foot lateral bounds; progress to 5-8 feet as frontal plane control and power improve. 5. Arm Drive Coordination: Swing arms across body in skating motion to enhance lateral momentum and counterbalance rotation forces. |
| **Scientific Reference** | PMC 7727409. Gluteus medius activation highest during single-limb hurdle hops (100% MVIC); true plyometric activities with direction changes elicit 150-190% MVIC; Lateral hop study showing gluteus maximus 45.55% MVIC pre-landing vs 36.81% controls; PMC 4556293. Hip-focused plyometric training increases hip abductor/extensor strength 18-25%, reduces knee valgus 15-25%, and achieves 72% ACL injury reduction; Knee valgus during landing prospectively predicts ACL injury risk in adolescent females |

## EXERCISE 6: FARMER WALKS (LOADED CARRIES)

| Column | Data |
|--------|------|
| **Exercise** | Farmer Walks (Loaded Carries) |
| **Primary Muscles** | Trapezius (Upper, Middle, Lower); Forearm Flexors (Flexor Digitorum Profundus, Flexor Digitorum Superficialis); Erector Spinae |
| **Secondary Muscles** | Rectus Abdominis; External Obliques; Internal Obliques; Quadratus Lumborum; Gluteus Maximus; Quadriceps Femoris; Gastrocnemius; Rhomboids; Latissimus Dorsi |
| **Type** | Compound |
| **Equipment** | Dumbbells, Kettlebells, or Farmer's Handles |
| **Level** | Intermediate |
| **Body Region** | Full Body |
| **Movement** | Conditioning |
| **Modality** | Free Weight |
| **Functional Groups** | Full_Body; Grip_Forearms; Traps_Upper_Back; Full_Core |
| **Steps for Beginners** | 1. Stand between two dumbbells or kettlebells of equal weight (start with 40-50% bodyweight per hand). 2. Hinge at hips, squat down, and grip weights with neutral wrist position using deadlift mechanics. 3. Stand up to full height by extending hips and knees, keeping chest up and shoulders back. 4. Brace core 360° (as if preparing for punch) and pack shoulders down and back. 5. Walk forward with short, controlled steps maintaining upright posture. 6. Continue walking for target distance (40-80 meters) or time (30-90 seconds). 7. Stop walking, hinge at hips, and carefully lower weights to ground using deadlift mechanics. |
| **Advanced Key Points** | 1. Postural Excellence: Maintain tall upright spine with chest up, shoulders packed (scapular depression and retraction), and neutral head position; avoid forward lean or rounded thoracic spine. 2. Core Bracing Strategy: Create 360° intra-abdominal pressure through circumferential core engagement; McGill's research shows this creates trunk stiffness critical for spinal stability under compressive load (2-4x bodyweight). 3. Grip Endurance vs Strength Trade-Off: If grip fails before target distance/time, use straps to continue set and stress intended musculature (core, traps, legs); separately train grip with dead hangs or thick bar work. 4. Gait Pattern Optimization: Take short controlled steps rather than long strides to minimize lateral sway and maintain spinal stability; think "shuffle forward" not "march." 5. Breathing Under Load: Use short nasal breaths maintaining slight core pressurization rather than full exhales; never hold breath for entire carry duration (risks blood pressure spike). |
| **Scientific Reference** | McGill SM et al. (2009). Farmer's walk shows peak abdominal/rectus femoris activation during stance, peak latissimus/erector spinae during swing phase. PubMed 19528856; PMC 11042841 (2024). Suitcase carry outperformed farmer's carry and plank for spinal stabilizer activation; Grip strength research shows it's more powerful predictor of cardiovascular mortality than systolic blood pressure; NSCA (2020). Loaded carries increase back endurance 15-22%, anaerobic capacity 8-12%, and reduce postural dysfunction |

Stand between two dumbbells or kettlebells of equal weight (start with 40-50% bodyweight per hand). 2. Hinge at hips, squat down, and grip weights with neutral wrist position using deadlift mechanics. 3. Stand up to full height by extending hips and knees, keeping chest up and shoulders back. 4. Brace core 360° (as if preparing for punch) and pack shoulders down and back. 5. Walk forward with short, controlled steps maintaining upright posture. 6. Continue walking for target distance (40-80 meters) or time (30-90 seconds). 7. Stop walking, hinge at hips, and carefully lower weights to ground using deadlift mechanics.","1. Postural Excellence: Maintain tall upright spine with chest up, shoulders packed (scapular depression and retraction), and neutral head position; avoid forward lean or rounded thoracic spine. 2. Core Bracing Strategy: Create 360° intra-abdominal pressure through circumferential core engagement; McGill's research shows this creates trunk stiffness critical for spinal stability under compressive load (2-4x bodyweight). 3. Grip Endurance vs Strength Trade-Off: If grip fails before target distance/time, use straps to continue set and stress intended musculature (core, traps, legs); separately train grip with dead hangs or thick bar work. 4. Gait Pattern Optimization: Take short controlled steps rather than long strides to minimize lateral sway and maintain spinal stability; think ""shuffle forward"" not ""march."" 5. Breathing Under Load: Use short nasal breaths maintaining slight core pressurization rather than full exhales; never hold breath for entire carry duration (risks blood pressure spike).","McGill SM et al. (2009). Farmer's walk shows peak abdominal/rectus femoris activation during stance, peak latissimus/erector spinae during swing phase. PubMed 19528856; PMC 11042841 (2024). Suitcase carry outperformed farmer's carry and plank for spinal stabilizer activation; Grip strength research shows it's more powerful predictor of cardiovascular mortality than systolic blood pressure; NSCA (2020). Loaded carries increase back endurance 15-22%, anaerobic capacity 8-12%, and reduce postural dysfunction","Strongman; CrossFit; American Football; Rugby; Wrestling; Judo/BJJ; Ice Hockey; Rowing; Rock Climbing; Military/Tactical; Manual Labor; General Fitness",Strength,Loaded_Carry,Free Weight,,,
