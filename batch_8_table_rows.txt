Dumbbell Lateral Raise | Deltoideus (lateral/middle head) | Deltoideus (anterior head), trapezius (upper fibers), supraspinatus | Isolation | Dumbbells | Beginner to Intermediate | Upper | Isolation | Free Weight | 1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding dumbbells at sides with palms facing inward (neutral grip) 2. Engage core and maintain slight bend in elbows (10-15 degrees) throughout movement 3. Raise both arms simultaneously out to sides and slightly forward (15-30 degrees from pure lateral) 4. Lift until arms reach shoulder height (90-degree abduction), pause briefly at top 5. Lower dumbbells with control back to starting position over 2-3 seconds 6. Avoid swinging or using momentum; keep movement smooth and controlled 7. Complete 10-15 repetitions maintaining strict form | 1. Lead with elbows rather than hands to maximize lateral deltoid engagement 2. Slight forward arm path (scapular plane) reduces impingement risk and optimizes mechanics 3. Pause at top for 1-2 seconds with conscious contraction of lateral deltoid 4. Control eccentric phase (3-4 seconds) for enhanced hypertrophic stimulus 5. Experiment with grip positions: neutral for overall activation, internal rotation for posterior emphasis | Campos, Y. A.

Front Plate Raise | Deltoideus (anterior head - clavicular portion) | Deltoideus (lateral head), pectoralis major (clavicular head), serratus anterior, trapezius (upper fibers) | Isolation | Weight plate | Beginner to Intermediate | Upper | Isolation | Free Weight | 1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding weight plate with both hands at thigh level (palms facing down or toward body) 2. Grip plate at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions or hold edges with overhand grip 3. Engage core and maintain neutral spine with shoulders back 4. Raise plate forward and upward in smooth arc, keeping arms relatively straight with slight elbow bend 5. Continue lifting until plate reaches eye level or shoulder height (90-degree shoulder flexion) 6. Pause briefly at top position, then slowly lower plate back to starting position with control 7. Complete 10-15 repetitions avoiding momentum or swinging | 1. Maintain scapular retraction throughout movement to prevent upper trap dominance 2. Lead movement with anterior deltoid, not arms - visualize pushing plate away from body 3. Controlled eccentric phase (3 seconds) maximizes time under tension 4. Keep plate 8-12 inches in front of face at top to maintain constant tension 5.
