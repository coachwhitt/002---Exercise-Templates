Stand facing elevated box/platform (12-20 inches), holding dumbbells at sides 2. Place right foot entirely on box surface 3. Push through right heel to lift body onto box 4. Bring left foot up to meet right foot on box 5. Step down with left foot first, then right foot 6. Complete all reps on right leg, then switch to left | 1. Box height selection: Knee angle at 90° when foot is on box = optimal quad activation 2. Drive mechanics: Push through heel of elevated foot—avoid pushing off trailing foot 3. Torso position: Slight forward lean (10-15°) increases glute engagement 4. Eccentric control: 2-3 second descent when stepping down—eccentric quad overload 5. Advanced variation: Lateral step-up increases glute medius activation vs standard forward step-up | Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during step-up exercises. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841.

Stand upright holding dumbbells at sides, feet hip-width apart 2. Step forward with right leg approximately 2-3 feet 3. Lower body by bending both knees to 90 degrees 4. Push through right heel and bring left leg forward into next lunge 5. Continue alternating legs while moving forward 6. Maintain upright torso throughout movement | 1. Step length: 2.5-3 feet stride length = optimal quad/glute balance—shorter emphasizes quads, longer emphasizes glutes 2. Continuous motion: Unlike stationary lunges, maintain forward momentum—builds dynamic stability 3. Knee tracking: Front knee tracks over 2nd-3rd toe throughout movement—never collapse inward 4. Core engagement: Anti-rotation demand high—brace core to prevent torso twisting 5. Breathing pattern: Inhale during step/descent, exhale during drive/next step | Stastny P et al. (2015).

Stand upright with feet hip-width apart, hands on hips 2. Step forward with right leg approximately 2-3 feet 3. Lower body by bending both knees until front thigh is parallel to floor 4. Keep front knee aligned over ankle, back knee hovers above floor 5. Push through front heel to return to starting position 6. Repeat on opposite leg, alternating sides | 1. Progression pathway: Bodyweight → holding light dumbbells → barbell front rack → barbell back rack 2. Knee position: Front knee stays behind toes—if knee passes toes, increase step length 3. Torso angle: Upright (vertical) = quad emphasis; forward lean (15-20°) = glute/hamstring emphasis 4. Tempo manipulation: Pause 2 seconds at bottom to eliminate momentum and maximize quad activation 5. Balance challenge: Narrow step width (single track) increases balance demand vs wide step (dual track) | Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during forward lunge. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841.

Shift weight to right leg, bend right knee and hip 4. Lower hips back and down until right thigh is parallel to floor 5. Push through right heel to return to center starting position 6. Repeat on opposite side, alternating | 1. Stance width: 2.5-3 feet lateral step = optimal adductor stretch and glute medius activation 2. Straight leg tension: Non-working leg remains straight with adductor actively lengthening 3. Hip hinge pattern: Sit back into hip—avoid forward knee drift over toes 4. Bar position: High bar (upper traps) = more upright; low bar (rear delts) = more forward lean 5. Foot angle: Working leg foot points forward or slightly outward (5-10°)—never inward | Distefano LJ et al. (2009). Gluteal muscle activation. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 39(12):532-540; Muyor JM et al.

Position barbell across upper back, stand to left side of elevated box 2. Place right foot entirely on box surface (lateral step) 3. Push through right heel to lift body onto box 4. Bring left foot up to meet right foot on box 5. Step down laterally with left foot first, then right foot 6. Complete all reps on right leg, then switch sides | 1. Lateral emphasis: Approach box from side (not front) to maximize frontal plane movement and glute medius activation 2. Drive mechanics: Push through heel of elevated foot—minimize push from trailing foot 3. Hip stability: Focus on preventing hip drop on non-elevated side—activates glute medius maximally 4. Box height: 15-20 inches = optimal for most athletes; higher box = greater glute activation 5.

Stand with feet together, hands clasped at chest or on hips 2. Take wide lateral step to right (2-3 feet), keeping left leg straight 3. Shift weight to right leg, bend right knee and push hips back 4. Lower hips until right thigh is parallel to floor, left leg remains straight 5. Push through right heel to return to center standing position 6. Repeat on opposite side, alternating | 1. Bodyweight foundation: Master this pattern before adding load (goblet DB → barbell) 2. Straight leg role: Non-working leg adductor eccentrically loads, then concentrically contracts to return 3. Hip hinge cue: "Sit back into a chair" on working leg—not forward knee bend 4. Knee tracking: Working knee tracks over 2nd-3rd toe—prevent knee valgus (collapse) 5. Progression: Add pause at bottom (2-3 sec) → pulse reps → goblet hold → barbell | Distefano LJ et al. (2009).

Sit in leg press machine, back flat against padded backrest 2. Place feet on platform shoulder-width apart, mid-foot position 3. Release safety handles, lower platform by bending knees to 90 degrees 4. Push through heels to extend legs, stopping just before lockout 5. Control descent back to 90-degree knee angle 6. Re-engage safety handles when set is complete | 1. Foot placement variation: High on platform = glute/hamstring emphasis; low = quad emphasis; wide = adductor involvement 2. Depth control: 90° knee angle = standard; deeper (100-110°) = greater quad activation but higher knee stress 3. Lower back safety: Maintain lumbar curve against pad—avoid "butt wink" (posterior pelvic tilt) at deep angles 4. Tempo manipulation: 3-second eccentric, 1-second pause, explosive concentric maximizes hypertrophy 5.

Stand upright with feet hip-width apart, hands on hips or at sides 2. Step forward with right leg approximately 2-3 feet 3. Lower body by bending both knees until front thigh is parallel to floor 4. Keep front knee aligned over ankle, back knee hovers above floor 5. Push through front heel to return to starting position 6. Repeat on opposite leg, alternating sides | 1. Foundation exercise: Master bodyweight before adding load (dumbbells → barbell) 2. Step length: 2-3 feet = balanced quad/glute activation; shorter = more quad; longer = more glute 3. Knee position: Front knee stays behind toes—if it passes, lengthen step 4. Torso manipulation: Upright = quad focus; forward lean (15-20°) = glute/hamstring focus 5. Tempo control: 2-second descent, 1-second pause, 1-second ascent eliminates momentum | Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during forward lunge. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841.

Lie supine on horizontal leg press machine, back flat against pad 2. Place feet on platform shoulder-width apart, mid-foot position 3. Release safety handles, bend knees to lower platform to 90-degree knee angle 4. Push through heels to extend legs, stopping just before lockout 5. Control descent back to 90-degree starting position 6. Re-engage safety handles after completing set | 1. Horizontal advantage: Lying position allows deeper knee flexion without lumbar flexion risk vs 45° leg press 2. Foot placement: Mid-platform = balanced; high = glute/hamstring; low = quad dominant 3. Lower back protection: Maintain natural lumbar curve—avoid tail tucking (posterior pelvic tilt) at bottom 4. Depth variation: 90° = standard; 100-110° = greater quad stretch and activation 5. Tempo strategy: 3-4 second eccentric maximizes quad hypertrophy; explosive concentric builds power | Lorenzetti S et al. (2020). EMG during leg press variants.

Position shoulders under padded supports of hack squat machine, back against pad 2. Place feet on platform shoulder-width apart, mid-foot position 3. Release safety handles, bend knees to lower until thighs parallel to platform 4. Keep back flat against pad throughout movement 5. Push through heels to extend legs, stopping just before lockout 6. Re-engage safety handles after completing set | 1. Quad isolation: Machine path eliminates balance demand—allows pure quad focus and heavier loading vs free squats 2. Spinal safety: Significantly lower erector spinae activation vs free weight squats—ideal for those with back issues 3. Foot placement: Low on platform = max quad; mid-platform = balanced; high = more glute/hamstring 4. Depth target: Full depth (thighs below parallel) maximizes vastus medialis activation 5. Tempo variation: Slow eccentric (3-4 sec) + pause (2 sec) + explosive concentric = hypertrophy protocol | Yavuz HU et al. (2015). EMG evaluation of squat variations.

Stand upright with feet hip-width apart, hands on hips or at sides 2. Step backward with right leg approximately 2-3 feet 3. Lower body by bending both knees until front thigh is parallel to floor 4. Keep front knee aligned over ankle, back knee hovers above floor 5. Push through front heel to return to starting position 6. Repeat on opposite leg, alternating sides | 1. Knee safety: Reverse lunge reduces anterior knee shear vs forward lunge—ideal for knee issues 2. Stationary limb focus: Front leg drives movement—emphasize pushing floor away 3. Weight distribution: 70% front leg, 30% back leg—back leg primarily for balance 4. Torso position: Slight forward lean (10-15°) increases glute activation in front leg 5. Progression: Bodyweight → dumbbells at sides → dumbbells at shoulders → barbell → deficit (elevate front foot) | Boullosa D et al. (2024). The reverse lunge: EMG study. Applied Sciences 14(24):11480.

Set up barbell in landmine attachment or secure one end in corner 2. Stand perpendicular to barbell, hold free end with right hand at shoulder height 3. Take wide lateral step to right (2-3 feet), left leg remains straight 4. Shift weight to right leg, bend right knee and push hips back 5. Lower until right thigh parallel to floor, maintain barbell at shoulder 6. Push through right heel to return to center starting position 7. Complete all reps on right side, then switch | 1. Anti-rotation demand: Single-arm load creates massive rotational force—obliques and transverse abdominis work intensely 2. Core bracing: Engage core before each rep—resist rotation toward loaded side 3. Hip stability: Prevent hip drop on non-working side—activates glute medius maximally 4. Barbell path: Keep barbell close to body—farther away increases core demand exponentially 5. Progression: Light barbell (33 lbs) → standard (45 lbs) → loaded barbell → single-arm overhead variation | Saeterbakken AH et al. (2020). Kinematic and EMG comparison of unilateral squats.

Stand with feet together, hold single dumbbell in right hand at side 2. Take wide lateral step to right (2-3 feet), left leg remains straight 3. Shift weight to right leg, bend right knee and push hips back 4. Lower until right thigh parallel to floor, dumbbell hangs at side 5. Push through right heel to return to center starting position 6. Complete all reps on right side, then switch (hold DB in left hand, step left) | 1. Load placement: Dumbbell on same side as working leg = quad/glute focus; opposite side = greater core anti-rotation demand 2. Hip hinge pattern: Sit back into hip—avoid forward knee translation over toes 3. Straight leg tension: Non-working leg adductor eccentrically loads, then concentrically contracts 4. Core stability: Resist lateral flexion toward weighted side—obliques work isometrically 5.

Step down with control, leading with same leg that stepped up. Complete all reps one side before switching, or alternate legs each rep. | Vastus lateralis and medialis show highest EMG activity during step-ups; Step-ups classified as very high glute activation exercise (>60% MVIC) but actual activation comparable to squats/lunges; Minimize push-off from trailing leg - elevated leg should perform 90%+ of work; Maintain upright torso position - excessive forward lean recruits more hamstring than quadriceps; Box height significantly affects muscle activation: higher boxes = more glute, lower boxes = more quadriceps | Muyor et al.

Continue pulling until bar reaches collarbone/upper chest, squeeze shoulder blades together 6. Pause briefly at bottom, then extend arms with control to starting position 7. Complete 10-15 reps maintaining constant tension on lats throughout | 1. Supinated grip provides biomechanical advantage for biceps brachii - allows heavier loads than pronated grip 2. Lower lat fibers emphasized more than pronated variations - excellent for "V-taper" development 3. Pull bar to upper chest, not behind neck - safer for shoulder joint, maintains better lat activation 4.

Select box height allowing hips above knee level (12-18" for beginners), stand 6-12" away 2. Assume athletic stance with feet hip to shoulder-width, toes forward, weight through midfoot 3. Initiate rapid quarter-squat (90-100° knee flexion) with arms swinging backward and downward 4. Explosively extend hips, knees, and ankles simultaneously (triple extension) while swinging arms upward 5. Keep body compact during flight with hips flexed and knees drawn toward chest 6. Land softly on box with both feet simultaneously, feet flat, hips above knees 7. Stand fully upright on box then step down one foot at a time (do not jump down) | 1. Stretch-shortening cycle optimization requires minimizing ground contact time (<0.2 sec) during countermovement 2. Land with decreased knee/hip flexion and increased knee valgus increases ACL loading—cue "land like a cat" 3. Optimal power occurs when hip extension slightly precedes knee extension during takeoff (proximal-to-distal sequencing) 4. Box heights 18-24" produce similar EMG activation to 30-36" with significantly reduced landing forces 5.

Stand with feet hip to shoulder-width, toes at starting line, weight through midfoot 2. Begin countermovement by flexing hips, knees, ankles to 90-100° knee flexion, arms swinging backward 3. At bottom position, torso leans forward 30-45° with arms extended behind body 4. Explosively extend hips, knees, ankles simultaneously while driving hips forward with 20-30° takeoff angle 5. Coordinate explosive arm swing forward and upward to shoulder height during takeoff 6. During flight, bring knees toward chest while reaching arms forward 7. Extend legs forward before landing, land heels first with 30-40° knee flexion, swing arms backward | 1. Horizontal force vector optimization requires 20-30° takeoff angle vs vertical plyometrics which use more upright posture 2. Gluteus maximus is primary force producer with activation exceeding 100% MVIC—athletes with greater glute CSA achieve longer distances 3. Arm swing contributes 10-15% of total distance via momentum transfer—triceps brachii and anterior deltoid most influential 4. Greatest muscle activation in gluteus maximus and biceps femoris during push-off phase, particularly with straddle foot position 5. Landing stability requires eccentric quadriceps/hamstring strength and core anti-extension strength to "stick" landing | Zhang Y et al. (2023).

Stand with feet hip to shoulder-width, lower into static squat position with 90° knee flexion, hands behind head 2. Hold bottom position completely still for 2-3 seconds to eliminate elastic energy contribution 3. Ensure knees track over toes, weight through midfoot, torso upright with neutral spine, hips level with knees 4. While holding static position, take deep breath and brace core for spinal stability 5. From dead-stop, explosively extend hips, knees, ankles simultaneously with maximal effort 6. Achieve maximal vertical displacement with full triple extension at takeoff, body in tall vertical alignment 7. Land with both feet simultaneously, immediately absorb impact via ankle/knee/hip flexion, return to static squat and hold 2-3 sec | 1. Concentric-only force production eliminates stretch-shortening cycle—squat jump height typically 10-15% lower than countermovement jump 2. Rate of force development in first 100-200ms is primary predictor of squat jump height, more so than maximal strength 3. Squat jumps demonstrate 10-15% higher vastus lateralis EMG activation vs countermovement jumps due to quadriceps dominance 4. 8-week jump squat training improves Fmax by ~18% and RFD100 by ~25%, with 2-4% improvement in 50m sprint times 5.

Lie face-down (prone) on mat with body fully extended, legs hip-width apart, arms overhead with palms down 2. Establish neutral spine by gently engaging core, pelvis remains in contact with mat throughout 3. Simultaneously lift chest, shoulders, and arms off mat by 4-6 inches by squeezing shoulder blades together 4. Simultaneously engage glutes and lift both legs off mat by 4-6 inches via hip extension, knees straight 5. Hold top position with arms and legs elevated forming slight arc, pelvis and lower abdomen maintain mat contact 6. Maintain superman position for 10-30 seconds with continuous muscle tension, shallow breathing if hold exceeds 10 sec 7. Slowly lower arms, chest, and legs simultaneously in controlled manner (2-3 sec descent), rest 5-10 sec | 1. Lumbar multifidus activation increases progressively: upper extremity only < lower extremity only < combined lift (highest, ~80-95% MVIC) 2. Gluteus maximus delayed activation pattern—consciously cue gluteal contraction before leg lift to optimize sequence and reduce erector spinae dominance 3. Abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) significantly enhances lumbar stability and increases gluteus maximus activity while decreasing compensatory erector spinae hyperactivity 4. Evidence-based progression: upper extremity only → lower extremity only → alternating arm/leg (bird dog) → full superman 5. Focus on "lengthen, don't crunch"—lift chest and legs modestly (4-6") with emphasis on muscle contraction quality, not height achieved | Kim SY & Kang MH (2018).

| Superman Hold | Erector Spinae, Lumbar Multifidus, Gluteus Maximus | Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus, Deltoideus Posterior, Trapezius, Rhomboideus Major, Rhomboideus Minor, Infraspinatus, Teres Major, Latissimus Dorsi | Isolation | Bodyweight | Intermediate | Core | Static Hold | Bodyweight | Lower_Back_Erector_Spinae; Gluteals; Full_Core | 1. Lie face-down on mat in fully extended position, legs hip-width, arms overhead with palms down or thumbs up 2. Before lifting, perform full-body tension check: engage glutes, brace core with gentle abdominal drawing-in, retract shoulder blades 3. In one smooth motion, simultaneously lift chest, arms, and legs off mat by 4-6 inches in even, balanced manner 4. Verify position: shoulder blades squeezed together, arms extended overhead with locked elbows, legs straight with feet together, gluteus maximus maximally contracted, pelvis maintains mat contact 5. Establish shallow rhythmic breathing through nose or mouth while maintaining core tension 6. Maintain superman hold for prescribed duration (20-60 sec intermediate; 60-90+ sec advanced) without sagging 7. At completion, slowly lower arms, chest, legs simultaneously over 2-3 sec, rest prone with complete relaxation 30-60 sec | 1. Moderate-intensity holds (30-40% MVIC) optimize erector spinae muscle stiffness development without excessive fatigue—aim for 45-90 sec holds 2. Systematic reviews show isometric lumbar extension exercises produce significant pain reduction (ES = -0.633, p = 0.004) and disability improvement in chronic low back pain 3. Sustained isometric nature produces greater type I muscle fiber recruitment vs dynamic variations—ideal for endurance adaptations 4. Superman holds develop core stability (resist unwanted movement) rather than core strength (produce movement)—superior for postural control 5. Progressive overload sequence: duration increase (20→30→45→60→90s) → increased sets (2→3→4) → reduced rest (60→45→30s) → instability → external load | Chen Z et al. (2023).

| Clean (Power Clean) | Gluteus Maximus, Semitendinosus, Biceps Femoris, Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Erector Spinae, Trapezius | Gastrocnemius, Soleus, Deltoids, Rhomboids, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Multifidus | Compound | Barbell | Advanced | Full Body | Explosive | Free Weight | Full_Body_Movements; Quads_Hamstrings_Glutes; Lower_Back_Erector_Spinae; Trapezius_and_Rhomboids | 1. Stand with feet hip-width, toes under barbell, squat down with chest up and grip bar with hook grip slightly wider than shoulders 2. Back straight, hips lower than shoulders, shoulders directly over or slightly in front of bar 3. Initiate lift by driving through heels and extending legs, angle of back remains constant, arms straight, bar close to shins 4. As bar passes knees, rebend knees slightly and bring torso more upright (scoop motion loads hamstrings/glutes) 5. Explosively extend hips, knees, ankles (triple extension) like vertical jump, shrug shoulders and pull body under bar 6. As you drop under bar, rotate elbows forward and around bar quickly, receive bar in front squat position on anterior deltoids, elbows high 7. Drive up from squat to full standing position | 1. Maximize triple extension—second pull generates majority of bar's upward velocity via violent hip extension 2. Bar trajectory must remain close to body throughout—bar path looping away reduces efficiency and power 3. Elbow speed in catch is critical for successful catch—requires significant shoulder mobility and aggressive action 4. Maintain consistent back angle during first pull—hips rising faster than shoulders turns lift into stiff-legged deadlift 5. Hook grip (thumb wrapped around bar, fingers over thumb) prevents bar slipping during high-velocity second pull | Gidday K et al. (2007). Biomechanical analysis of power clean at 70% vs 90% of 1RM.

| Clean and Jerk | Gluteus Maximus, Quadriceps, Erector Spinae, Deltoids, Triceps Brachii, Trapezius | Hamstrings, Gastrocnemius, Soleus, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Serratus Anterior, Pectoralis Major | Compound | Barbell | Advanced | Full Body | Explosive | Free Weight | Full_Body_Movements; Quads_Hamstrings_Glutes; Shoulders_Delts_and_Traps; Arms_Triceps | 1. Perform full Clean movement receiving bar in full deep front squat 2. From bottom of squat, drive through heels to stand to fully erect position with bar resting on anterior deltoids 3. With feet hip-width, initiate jerk with shallow controlled dip by bending knees, torso upright, elbows high 4. Explosively drive upward with legs, extending hips and knees to propel barbell off shoulders 5. As bar leaves shoulders, quickly split legs one forward one backward into lunge position, simultaneously press body under bar locking elbows overhead 6. Once stable, bring front foot halfway back, then back foot to meet it, stand with feet together, bar held overhead 7. Carefully lower bar to shoulders then to floor | 1. Jerk dip should be shallow and straight down—drive must be vertical and powerful using leg power to create upward momentum 2. Split should be long and stable with front shin vertical and back knee slightly bent for solid base of support 3. During jerk drive, head must move back out of bar path then come forward "through the window" once bar clears chin 4. Take deep breath and brace core before clean and again before jerk—intra-abdominal pressure crucial for spinal stability 5. Clean and Jerk is rhythmic lift—transition from clean's recovery to jerk's dip should be seamless but controlled | Gourgoulis V et al. (2009). Three-dimensional kinematic analysis of clean and jerk. J Sports Sciences 22(5):459-469; Campos J et al. (2006). Kinematical analysis of clean and jerk. J Strength Cond Res 20(3):508-513; Hadi G et al. (2012).

| Hang Clean | Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings, Trapezius, Erector Spinae, Deltoids | Quadriceps, Gastrocnemius, Rhomboids, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques | Compound | Barbell | Advanced | Full Body | Explosive | Free Weight | Full_Body_Movements; Legs_Hamstrings; Gluteals; Trapezius_and_Rhomboids | 1. Deadlift barbell to standing position, hinge at hips and slightly bend knees to lower bar to "hang" position just above knees 2. From hang position, explosively extend hips, knees, ankles (triple extension) in powerful vertical jumping motion 3. As body reaches full extension, shrug shoulders powerfully and use momentum to pull body under bar, arms remain straight 4. Quickly rotate elbows forward and around bar, receive bar in front squat position on anterior deltoids 5. Drive up from squat to full standing position 6. Safely lower bar back to hang position or to floor | 1. Hang position emphasizes eccentric loading of hamstrings and glutes—feel tension build before initiating explosive pull 2. Power comes from hips not arms—arms act as ropes guiding bar upward only after full hip and leg extension 3. Hang clean forces more pronounced violent hip extension to generate vertical momentum since there's no "first pull" from floor 4. Maintain balance over mid-foot—pressure shifts from mid-foot toward ball of foot culminating in "jump" 5. Varying hang positions (high-hang/hip, mid-thigh, below knee) targets specific phases and develops power from different joint angles | Sato K et al. (2017).

| Snatch (Power Snatch) | Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings, Quadriceps, Erector Spinae, Deltoids, Trapezius | Gastrocnemius, Rhomboids, Serratus Anterior, Triceps Brachii, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques | Compound | Barbell | Advanced | Full Body | Explosive | Free Weight | Full_Body_Movements; Quads_Hamstrings_Glutes; Shoulders_Delts_and_Traps | 1. Feet hip-width apart, grip barbell with very wide grip (snatch grip), squat down with straight back, chest up, hips low 2. Drive with legs to lift bar from floor, arms straight, bar close to shins, back angle constant until bar passes knees 3. As bar clears knees, explosively extend hips, knees, ankles, bar makes contact with hip crease propelling it vertically 4. After full extension, shrug shoulders and actively pull body under bar, keep bar close to torso 5. Receive bar overhead with arms locked in partial squat, head "through the window" slightly forward of arms 6. Stand up from squat to full upright position with bar held securely overhead | 1. Ideal snatch grip width allows bar to rest in hip crease when standing tall—crucial for maximizing power transfer during second pull 2. Snatch demands exceptional shoulder and thoracic spine mobility and stability to support weight overhead 3. Speed under bar often described as "jumping and landing in squat"—speed of transition from extending upwards to pulling downwards determines success 4. Active shoulders in catch position—shoulders pushed up towards ears creating stable "bone-on-bone" support structure 5. Do not cut second pull short—ensure full violent triple extension before initiating pull under bar | Gourgoulis V et al. (2000). Three-dimensional kinematic analysis of snatch. J Sports Sciences 18(8):643-652; Harbili E (2012). Gender-based kinematic and kinetic analysis of snatch lift. J Sports Science Medicine 11(1):162-169; Stone MH et al. (2006).

| Thruster | Gluteus Maximus, Quadriceps, Deltoids, Triceps Brachii | Hamstrings, Erector Spinae, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Trapezius, Serratus Anterior | Compound | Barbell | Intermediate | Full Body | Explosive | Free Weight | Full_Body_Movements; Legs_Quadriceps; Shoulders_Delts_and_Traps; Arms_Triceps | 1. Hold barbell in front rack position resting on anterior deltoids with loose fingertip grip, feet shoulder-width 2. Initiate movement by sending hips back and down into full front squat, chest up, back straight, elbows high 3. From bottom of squat, explosively drive upwards through heels 4. As you approach top of squat, use powerful momentum from hip extension to begin pressing barbell overhead 5. Continue press until arms fully locked overhead, head moves slightly back then forward "through the window" 6. In controlled manner, lower bar back to front rack position and immediately descend into next squat, movement fluid and continuous | 1. Key is seamless transfer of energy from lower body to upper body—press initiated by hip drive not as separate movement 2. Develop consistent breathing pattern—typically inhale on way down, exhale forcefully as driving weight overhead 3. Keeping elbows high in front squat crucial for maintaining upright torso and solid "shelf" for bar 4. Overhead portion is push press driven by leg momentum—avoid turning into strict press which limits weight 5. For very heavy thrusters or fatigued state, slight re-bend of knees as bar comes off shoulders can help re-accelerate it overhead | Gullett JC et al. (2009).

| Kettlebell Swings | Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings, Erector Spinae | Latissimus Dorsi, Deltoids, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Quadriceps, Forearm Flexors | Compound | Kettlebell | Intermediate | Full Body | Explosive | Free Weight | Gluteals; Legs_Hamstrings; Lower_Back_Erector_Spinae; Full_Body_Movements | 1. Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, place kettlebell about a foot in front on floor 2. Hinge at hips keeping back flat and grip kettlebell with both hands, "hike" kettlebell back between legs high into groin 3. Explosively drive hips forward, squeeze glutes and straighten legs—hip thrust propels kettlebell forward and up 4. Allow kettlebell to float up to chest height, arms relaxed acting like ropes, do not lift with shoulders 5. As kettlebell descends, let gravity do work, guide it back between legs as you hinge at hips for next rep 6. Exhale sharply at top of swing, inhale as you hinge back | 1. It's a hinge not a squat—primary movement is horizontal projection of hips (hip hinge), knees bend only to facilitate hinge 2. Sharp exhalation at top ("tssss" sound) helps brace core and amplify power production 3. Before hike, "pack" shoulders down and back to engage lats—keeps kettlebell connected to body and protects lower back 4. At apex of swing, body forms rigid vertical plank with glutes and abs contracted hard—avoid leaning back or hyper-extending spine 5. Don't fight kettlebell on downswing—let it fall and only hinge hips back at last moment maximizing stretch-shortening cycle | McGill SM & Marshall LW (2012).

| Prowler Push | Quadriceps, Gluteus Maximus, Gastrocnemius, Soleus | Hamstrings, Erector Spinae, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Deltoids, Pectoralis Major, Triceps Brachii | Compound | Prowler / Sled | Beginner | Full Body | Push | Other | Legs_Quadriceps; Gluteals; Quads_Hamstrings_Glutes; Full_Body_Movements | 1. Load prowler with appropriate weight, start light to master form 2. Stand behind prowler and grip vertical push-handles, arms bent or nearly straight, lean body forward at 45° 3. Step forward and drive with legs pushing sled, body forms straight line from head to heels 4. Continue driving sled forward with powerful deliberate steps, focus on pushing ground away behind you 5. Maintain posture with core braced and back flat throughout, avoid letting hips sag or back round | 1. Body angle dictates focus—more upright posture (high-handle) better for speed/acceleration, lower body angle (low-handle) increases leg load for strength 2. Movement is leg drive not arm push—arms and torso act as rigid structure to transfer force from legs into sled 3. For strength use powerful shorter strides, for speed/conditioning use longer more rapid strides with high knee drive 4. Regardless of weight, push with maximal intent and aggression on every step—excellent for concentric power without eccentric loading 5. Find rhythmic breathing pattern matching stride cadence—heavy slow pushes may breathe between steps, lighter faster pushes more rapid breathing | Wyland JP et al. (2015).

| Kettlebell Row (Double Arm) | Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Trapezius | Biceps Brachii, Erector Spinae, Hamstrings, Gluteus Maximus, Posterior Deltoids, Forearm Flexors | Compound | Two Kettlebells | Intermediate | Upper | Pull | Free Weight | Back_Latissimus_Dorsi; Trapezius_and_Rhomboids; Forearms_Grip | 1. Place two kettlebells on floor in front, stand with feet shoulder-width 2. Hinge at hips keeping back straight and chest up until torso nearly parallel to floor, bend knees slightly 3. Grasp kettlebells with neutral grip (palms facing), arms fully extended 4. Engage core and pull shoulder blades down and back 5. Drive elbows up and back, pull kettlebells toward lower ribcage, squeeze back muscles at top 6. In controlled manner, lower kettlebells back to starting position 7. Ensure spine remains neutral throughout exercise | 1. At peak contraction, actively squeeze shoulder blades together (scapular retraction) to maximize rhomboid and mid-trap engagement 2. Incorporate 1-2 second pause at peak contraction to increase time under tension and enhance mind-muscle connection 3. Bilateral row with heavy loads places high demand on erector spinae to resist spinal flexion—focus on maintaining rigid neutral spine 4. Drive elbows towards ceiling keeping them close to body—emphasizes latissimus dorsi over upper traps and biceps 5. Control descent of kettlebells—slow controlled eccentric phase (3-4 sec) enhances muscle damage and stimulates hypertrophy | Saeterbakken A et al. (2015).

| Kettlebell Row (Single Arm) | Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Trapezius, Obliques | Biceps Brachii, Erector Spinae, Hamstrings, Gluteus Maximus, Posterior Deltoids, Quadratus Lumborum | Compound | Kettlebell | Intermediate | Upper | Pull | Free Weight | Back_Latissimus_Dorsi; Trapezius_and_Rhomboids; Full_Core | 1. Place kettlebell on floor next to bench, place left knee and left hand firmly on bench, back flat and parallel to floor 2. Right foot planted firmly on floor to side 3. Reach down and grasp kettlebell with right hand using neutral grip, arm fully extended 4. Engage core to prevent torso rotation 5. Drive right elbow up and back, pull kettlebell toward hip, focus on initiating pull with back muscles not arm 6. At top squeeze back and lat muscles 7. Slowly lower kettlebell without letting torso rotate, complete all reps before switching | 1. Primary challenge is resisting rotational pull on torso—actively engage contralateral obliques to keep hips and shoulders square to floor 2. Unilateral row allows greater range of motion and deeper stretch in lat—allow shoulder blade to protract at bottom for full stretch before retracting 3. For advanced athletic variation, perform row from hip hinge stance without bench support requiring significantly more core, glute, hamstring engagement 4. Initiate pull by retracting scapula before any elbow flexion occurs—ensures latissimus dorsi and rhomboids are prime movers 5. Instead of pulling straight up, think about pulling kettlebell in slight "J" or arc-like path back toward hip to maximize lat activation | Saeterbakken A et al. (2015). Effect of bi- and unilateral rowing on core activation. Int J Sports Med 36(11):901-905; Heinecke ML et al. (2010). EMG analysis of unilateral bent-over row and biceps curl.

| Machine Row | Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Trapezius | Biceps Brachii, Posterior Deltoids, Erector Spinae | Compound | Seated Row Machine | Beginner | Upper | Pull | Machine | Back_Latissimus_Dorsi; Trapezius_and_Rhomboids | 1. Adjust seat height so chest is firmly against chest pad and arms parallel to floor when reaching for handles 2. Grasp handles with neutral grip (palms facing in), sit tall with back straight and chest up 3. Extend arms fully without rounding shoulders or back, feel slight stretch in back muscles 4. Keeping torso stationary, pull handles towards abdomen, focus on driving elbows back and squeezing shoulder blades together 5. Pause for moment at peak contraction squeezing back muscles hard 6. Slowly and with control, return handles to starting position allowing shoulder blades to protract forward 7. Do not use lower back to rock back and forth—movement isolated to arms and back | 1. Grip variation for muscle emphasis: wide pronated grip increases upper trapezius/posterior deltoid activation, narrow supinated grip increases biceps/lower lat involvement 2. To better isolate lats, think about "pulling with elbows" rather than hands—imagine hands are just hooks 3. Exaggerate scapular movement allowing full protraction at start (shoulder blades gliding forward) and full retraction at end (squeezing together) 4. Utilize tempo training (e.g., 3-1-2-1: 3-sec eccentric, 1-sec pause at stretch, 2-sec concentric, 1-sec pause at peak) to eliminate momentum 5. Internal verbal cues like "squeeze the shoulder blades" significantly increase trapezius activation | Muyor JM et al. (2023). Influence of shoulder abduction angle and grip on muscle activation during seated cable row. Sports Biomechanics; Snyder BJ & Leech JR (2009).

| Suspended Row | Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Trapezius | Biceps Brachii, Posterior Deltoids, Erector Spinae, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Gluteus Maximus | Compound | Suspension Trainer | Beginner | Upper | Pull | Bodyweight | Back_Latissimus_Dorsi; Trapezius_and_Rhomboids; Full_Core | 1. Secure suspension trainer to high anchor point, adjust straps so handles at chest height 2. Grab handles and lean back until arms fully extended, walk feet forward to increase difficulty (more horizontal = harder) 3. Body forms straight rigid plank from head to heels, engage core and glutes 4. Initiate movement by retracting shoulder blades, then drive elbows back to pull chest towards handles 5. At top squeeze back muscles 6. Lower body back to starting position with control, do not let hips sag 7. Keep core and glutes engaged throughout entire set | 1. Inherent instability of suspension trainer forces greater activation of stabilizer muscles in shoulder girdle and core vs fixed-equipment rows 2. Primary progression is by decreasing body angle relative to floor—walking feet further forward makes exercise significantly harder 3. Single-leg variation lifting one leg dramatically increases demand on core and hip stability challenging anti-rotation and anti-extension 4. Start with pronated grip and rotate to neutral or supinated at peak contraction to increase biceps involvement and provide unique stimulus 5. To achieve highest difficulty, place feet on elevated surface making body parallel to floor at start | Youdas JW et al. (2018).

| Suspended Reverse Mountain Climbers | Rectus Abdominis, Obliques | Transverse Abdominis, Hip Flexors, Serratus Anterior, Deltoids, Triceps Brachii | Compound | Suspension Trainer | Advanced | Core | Dynamic | Bodyweight | Abdominal_Total; Abdominal_Obliques; Full_Core | 1. Adjust suspension straps to mid-calf height, sit facing away from anchor and place feet into handles 2. Roll over into plank position with hands directly under shoulders and feet suspended in straps 3. Form straight rigid line from head to suspended heels, brace core and engage glutes 4. While keeping torso still, slowly bring RIGHT knee towards LEFT elbow (reverse and cross-body component) 5. Extend right leg back to starting plank position with control 6. Now bring LEFT knee towards RIGHT elbow 7. Continue alternating legs in slow controlled "climbing" motion without letting hips sag or rotate | 1. Main goal is maintaining neutral spine—core works overtime to prevent lower back arching (anti-extension) and hips twisting (anti-rotation) 2. This is not cardio exercise—perform movement slowly to maximize time under tension for abdominal wall and force greater stabilizer engagement 3. Actively push ground away to keep shoulders stable and scapulae protracted engaging serratus anterior and preventing winging 4. Focus on feeling contraction in lower abs and obliques as you drive knee across body 5. Maintain consistent hip height—common error is hips piking up or sagging down, neutral plank-like position is key | Byrne JM et al. (2014). Effect of suspension training-based core program on high school rowers. J Strength Cond Res 28(11):3041-3047; Calatayud J et al. (2014).

| Conditioning Ball Reverse Jack Knife | Rectus Abdominis, Transverse Abdominis, Hip Flexors | Obliques, Serratus Anterior, Quadriceps, Deltoids, Triceps Brachii | Compound | Stability Ball | Intermediate | Core | Dynamic | Bodyweight | Abdominal_Total; Abdominal_Lower; Full_Core | 1. Start in push-up position with hands on floor shoulder-width apart 2. Place tops of feet and shins on stability ball 3. Body forms straight line from head to heels in plank position, brace core, arms straight 4. Keeping back flat, engage lower abs to pull knees towards chest allowing ball to roll forward 5. With control, extend legs back to starting plank position 6. For advanced pike variation: from plank position, engage abs to lift hips high towards ceiling keeping legs as straight as possible, ball rolls towards feet 7. Slowly lower hips back down to starting plank position | 1. Pike vs knee tuck: knee tuck (jack knife) primarily targets lower rectus abdominis and hip flexors, pike (straight legs, hips high) increases demand on entire rectus abdominis and requires greater shoulder stability and hamstring flexibility 2. Perform movement slowly and deliberately—avoid using momentum to swing hips or knees, work comes from conscious abdominal contraction 3. Lowering phase (extending back to plank) just as important as concentric phase—control return to plank to maximize muscle engagement and prevent lower back strain 4. Keep shoulders pushed away from ears and directly over wrists—don't let them collapse or shift too far forward or back 5. In knee tuck focus on keeping back flat, in pike spine will naturally flex but movement driven from abs lifting hips not from rounding back | Escamilla RF et al. (2010).
