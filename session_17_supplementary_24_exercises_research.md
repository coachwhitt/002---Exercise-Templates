**Scientific Evidence:**
- Overhead variations (including decline) more effective than lying flat for overall triceps
- Overhead positions activate long head more effectively due to stretch (76% vs 62% MVIC)
- Decline angle increases long head activation vs flat bench
- Single-arm variations allow identification and correction of bilateral imbalances

5. Extend elbows to press dumbbells back to starting position, achieve full lockout
6. Maintain fixed upper arm position - only elbows move
7. Complete 10-15 reps with controlled tempo (2 seconds down, 1 second up)

**Advanced Cues:**
1. Decline angle increases long head stretch vs flat bench, enhancing activation
2. Keep upper arms perpendicular to floor and stationary - all movement from elbow only
3. Full ROM critical: lower until maximum stretch, extend to complete lockout
4. Single-arm variations reveal bilateral strength imbalances common in athletes
5. EZ-bar grip more wrist-friendly than straight bar for those with mobility limitations

**Beginner Steps (Bodyweight):**
1. Stand tall with feet hip-width apart, take large step forward with right foot (2-3 feet)
2. Position feet in staggered stance: front foot flat, rear foot on ball of foot (heel elevated)
3. Maintain upright torso, engage core, hands on hips or at chest for balance
4. Lower body straight down by bending both knees simultaneously until front thigh parallel to floor
5. Front knee should track over toes (not past), rear knee descends toward floor (1-2 inches above)
6. Press through front foot heel to drive body back to starting position
7. Complete 10-15 reps on right leg, then switch to left leg

**Beginner Steps (Loaded - Barbell or Dumbbells):**
1. For dumbbells: Hold dumbbells at sides with neutral grip
2. For barbell: Position barbell on upper back (high bar) or rear delts (low bar)
3. Follow same movement pattern as bodyweight variation
4. Start with light weight to master balance and form before progressing load

**Advanced Cues:**
1. Upright torso emphasizes quadriceps; forward torso lean (10-20 degrees) increases glute/hamstring activation by 3-6%
2. Front foot positioning: Heel 2-3 feet in front of rear foot for optimal biomechanics
3. Weight distribution: 70-80% of weight on front leg, 20-30% on rear leg for stability
4. Knee tracking critical: front knee must track over toes, avoid inward collapse (valgus)
5. Split squats show higher hamstring-to-quadriceps EMG ratio vs bilateral squats - excellent for posterior chain development

6. Lower leg with control, switch to opposite leg after brief rest
7. Progress by increasing hold duration or adding arm lift

**Advanced Steps (One Arm, Two Legs OR Opposite Arm/Leg - Hardest):**
1. Start in standard front plank on forearms
2. **One Arm Variation:** Slowly lift one forearm off floor, extending arm forward or placing hand on hip
3. **Opposite Arm/Leg (Hardest):** Simultaneously lift opposite arm and leg (e.g., right arm + left leg)
4. Hold position for 10-30 seconds, fighting rotation and maintaining level hips/shoulders
5. Lower with control, switch to opposite side after brief rest

**Advanced Cues:**
1. Tripod variations create massive anti-rotation and anti-extension core demands vs standard plank
2. Gluteus maximus, hamstrings, and erector spinae show very high activation (>61% MVIC) with leg lift
3. External and internal obliques highly activated to prevent torso rotation
4. Opposite arm/leg variation (contralateral) is most challenging due to cross-body stabilization
5. Maintain rigid body position - avoid hip drop, rotation, or spine hyperextension
