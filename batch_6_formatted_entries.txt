| Dumbbell Lunge | Quadriceps (Rectus Femoris, Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius), Gluteus Maximus | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus), Gluteus Medius, Adductor Magnus, Erector Spinae | Compound | Dumbbells (pair) | Beginner | Lower | Push | Free Weight | 1. Stand upright holding dumbbells at sides, feet hip-width apart 2. Step forward with right leg approximately 2-3 feet 3. Lower body by bending both knees to 90 degrees 4. Keep front knee aligned over ankle, avoid knee passing toes 5. Push through front heel to return to starting position 6. Repeat on opposite leg, alternating sides | 1. Load progression: Start bodyweight → light dumbbells (5-10 lbs) → moderate (15-25 lbs) → heavy (30+ lbs) 2. Torso position: Maintain upright posture—forward lean increases glute/hamstring, vertical torso emphasizes quads 3. Knee tracking: Front knee tracks in line with 2nd-3rd toe throughout movement 4. Tempo control: 2-second descent, 1-second pause at bottom, 1-second ascent maximizes quad activation 5. Breathing pattern: Inhale during descent, exhale forcefully during ascent to maintain core tension | Xie et al. (2025). Lunge biomechanics. PLoS One; Muyor JM et al. (2020). Electromyographic activity in lunges. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0230841; Physical Activity and Health (2025).

Stand upright holding dumbbells at sides, feet hip-width apart 2. Step backward with right leg approximately 2-3 feet 3. Lower body by bending both knees until front thigh is parallel to floor 4. Keep front knee aligned over ankle, back knee hovers above floor 5. Push through front heel to return to starting position 6. Repeat on opposite leg, alternating sides | 1. Biomechanical advantage: Reverse lunge reduces anterior knee shear force vs forward lunge—safer for knee health 2. Stationary limb focus: Front (stationary) leg drives movement—push floor away to emphasize quad activation 3. Back leg role: Moving leg primarily for balance—keep weight distribution 70% front/30% back 4. Torso angle: Slight forward lean (10-15°) increases glute activation in stationary limb 5. Tempo variation: Pause 2 seconds at bottom position to eliminate momentum and maximize quad time-under-tension | Boullosa D et al. (2024). The Reverse Lunge: A Descriptive Electromyographic Study. Applied Sciences 14(24):11480. DOI: 10.3390/app142411480; Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during lunge variations. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841; Stastny P et al. (2015). Dumbbell-carrying position effects.

Shift weight to right leg, bend right knee while keeping left leg straight 4. Lower hips back and down until right thigh is parallel to floor 5. Push through right heel to return to starting position 6. Repeat on opposite side, alternating | 1. Lead leg mechanics: Hip hinge pattern—sit back into hip, not forward over knee 2. Straight leg tension: Passive leg adductor elongates eccentrically, then shortens concentrically to bring legs together 3. Knee tracking: Lead knee tracks over 2nd toe—avoid knee valgus (collapsing inward) 4. Foot position: Lead foot points forward or slightly outward (5-10°)—never inward 5. Load progression: Goblet hold (single DB at chest) → dual DBs at sides → dual DBs at shoulders for progression | Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG activity during lateral movements. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841; Distefano LJ et al. (2009). Gluteal muscle activation during exercises. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 39(12):532-540; Ekstrom RA et al. (2007). Surface EMG analysis.

Stand 2-3 feet in front of elevated bench, holding dumbbells at sides 2. Place top of right foot on bench behind you (laces down) 3. Lower body by bending front knee until thigh is parallel to floor 4. Keep front knee aligned over ankle, torso upright 5. Push through front heel to return to starting position 6. Complete all reps on one leg, then switch | 1. Trunk angle manipulation: Forward lean (15-20°) increases glute/hamstring; upright torso emphasizes quads 2. Front foot position: 2-3 feet from bench—closer = more quad, farther = more glute/hamstring 3. Rear foot placement: Laces down on bench (not ball of foot) reduces rear leg contribution 4. Load distribution: 90% weight on front leg—back leg is for balance only 5. Deficit variation: Elevate front foot 2-4 inches to increase ROM and quad stretch | Slater LV et al. (2025). Targeted muscle activation in Bulgarian split squat variations. BMC Sports Sci Med Rehabil 17:28. DOI: 10.1186/s13102-025-01306-z; Yavuz HU et al. (2014). Muscle activation in Bulgarian squat.

Hold single dumbbell vertically at chest level, hands cupping top end (goblet position) 2. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly outward (5-15°) 3. Initiate movement by pushing hips back and bending knees 4. Lower body until thighs are parallel to floor or below (full depth if mobility allows) 5. Keep chest up, elbows inside knees at bottom 6. Push through heels to return to standing position | 1. Goblet position advantage: DB at chest encourages upright torso—reduces forward lean common in back squats 2. Elbow-knee contact: At bottom, use elbows to gently push knees outward to activate glute medius 3. Depth progression: Quarter squat → parallel → ass-to-grass as mobility improves 4. Breathing: Inhale at top + brace core, hold breath during descent, exhale past sticking point on ascent 5. Load ceiling: Goblet squat limited by upper body—transition to barbell front squat when exceeding 60-70 lbs | Makaruk B et al. (2021). Goblet squat vs landmine squat.

Bring left foot up to meet right foot on box 5. Step down with left foot first, then right foot 6. Complete all reps on right leg, then switch to left | 1. Box height selection: Knee angle at 90° when foot is on box = optimal quad activation 2. Drive mechanics: Push through heel of elevated foot—avoid pushing off trailing foot 3. Torso position: Slight forward lean (10-15°) increases glute engagement 4. Eccentric control: 2-3 second descent when stepping down—eccentric quad overload 5. Advanced variation: Lateral step-up increases glute medius activation vs standard forward step-up | Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during step-up exercises. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841.

Push through right heel and bring left leg forward into next lunge 5. Continue alternating legs while moving forward 6. Maintain upright torso throughout movement | 1. Step length: 2.5-3 feet stride length = optimal quad/glute balance—shorter emphasizes quads, longer emphasizes glutes 2. Continuous motion: Unlike stationary lunges, maintain forward momentum—builds dynamic stability 3. Knee tracking: Front knee tracks over 2nd-3rd toe throughout movement—never collapse inward 4. Core engagement: Anti-rotation demand high—brace core to prevent torso twisting 5. Breathing pattern: Inhale during step/descent, exhale during drive/next step | Stastny P et al. (2015). EMG in walking lunge. J Hum Kinet 49:59-67; Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during forward lunge. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841; Macadam P et al. (2021). Lunges vs back squats.

Keep front knee aligned over ankle, back knee hovers above floor 5. Push through front heel to return to starting position 6. Repeat on opposite leg, alternating sides | 1. Progression pathway: Bodyweight → holding light dumbbells → barbell front rack → barbell back rack 2. Knee position: Front knee stays behind toes—if knee passes toes, increase step length 3. Torso angle: Upright (vertical) = quad emphasis; forward lean (15-20°) = glute/hamstring emphasis 4. Tempo manipulation: Pause 2 seconds at bottom to eliminate momentum and maximize quad activation 5. Balance challenge: Narrow step width (single track) increases balance demand vs wide step (dual track) | Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during forward lunge. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841.

Re-engage safety handles when set is complete | 1. Foot placement variation: High on platform = glute/hamstring emphasis; low = quad emphasis; wide = adductor involvement 2. Depth control: 90° knee angle = standard; deeper (100-110°) = greater quad activation but higher knee stress 3. Lower back safety: Maintain lumbar curve against pad—avoid "butt wink" (posterior pelvic tilt) at deep angles 4. Tempo manipulation: 3-second eccentric, 1-second pause, explosive concentric maximizes hypertrophy 5. Single-leg variation: Unilateral leg press identifies left/right imbalances and increases stability demand | Lorenzetti S et al. (2020). Evaluation of lower limb muscles' EMG during leg press.

| Single-Arm Barbell Side Squat | Gluteus Medius (emphasized), Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis), Adductors (Adductor Magnus, Adductor Longus) | Gluteus Maximus, Core stabilizers (anti-rotation: Obliques, Transverse Abdominis), Erector Spinae, Hamstrings | Compound | Barbell (landmine setup or one end on floor) | Advanced | Lower | Push | Free Weight | 1. Set up barbell in landmine attachment or secure one end in corner 2. Stand perpendicular to barbell, hold free end with right hand at shoulder height 3. Take wide lateral step to right (2-3 feet), left leg remains straight 4. Shift weight to right leg, bend right knee and push hips back 5. Lower until right thigh parallel to floor, maintain barbell at shoulder 6. Push through right heel to return to center starting position 7. Complete all reps on right side, then switch | 1. Anti-rotation demand: Single-arm load creates massive rotational force—obliques and transverse abdominis work intensely 2. Core bracing: Engage core before each rep—resist rotation toward loaded side 3. Hip stability: Prevent hip drop on non-working side—activates glute medius maximally 4. Barbell path: Keep barbell close to body—farther away increases core demand exponentially 5. Progression: Light barbell (33 lbs) → standard (45 lbs) → loaded barbell → single-arm overhead variation | Saeterbakken AH et al. (2020). Kinematic and EMG comparison of unilateral squats. Int J Environ Res Public Health 17(13):4610. DOI: 10.3390/ijerph17134610; Muyor JM et al. (2020). EMG during monopodal squat. PLoS One 15(4):e0230841; Distefano LJ et al. (2009).

| Single-Arm Dumbbell Side Squat | Gluteus Medius, Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis), Adductors (Adductor Magnus, Adductor Longus) | Gluteus Maximus, Core stabilizers (anti-rotation: Obliques), Hamstrings, Erector Spinae | Compound | Dumbbell (single) | Intermediate | Lower | Push | Free Weight | 1. Stand with feet together, hold single dumbbell in right hand at side 2. Take wide lateral step to right (2-3 feet), left leg remains straight 3. Shift weight to right leg, bend right knee and push hips back 4. Lower until right thigh parallel to floor, dumbbell hangs at side 5. Push through right heel to return to center starting position 6. Complete all reps on right side, then switch (hold DB in left hand, step left) | 1. Load placement: Dumbbell on same side as working leg = quad/glute focus; opposite side = greater core anti-rotation demand 2. Hip hinge pattern: Sit back into hip—avoid forward knee translation over toes 3. Straight leg tension: Non-working leg adductor eccentrically loads, then concentrically contracts 4. Core stability: Resist lateral flexion toward weighted side—obliques work isometrically 5. Progression: Light DB (10-15 lbs) → moderate (20-30 lbs) → heavy (35+ lbs) → goblet hold at chest → two DBs | Saeterbakken AH et al. (2020). Kinematic and EMG of unilateral squats.

| Single-Leg Barbell Squat | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris), Gluteus Maximus, Gluteus Medius (emphasized) | Hamstrings, Core stabilizers (anti-rotation, anti-lateral flexion), Erector Spinae, Adductors | Compound | Barbell | Advanced | Lower | Push | Free Weight | 1. Position barbell across upper back (high bar position) 2. Stand on right leg, left leg extended forward or held behind (counterbalance) 3. Initiate descent by pushing hips back and bending right knee 4. Lower as deep as mobility allows while maintaining balance 5. Keep right knee tracking over toes, chest up 6. Push through right heel to return to standing 7. Complete all reps on right leg, then switch | 1. Prerequisite strength: Master bodyweight pistol squats before adding barbell 2. Balance aids: Use TRX/suspension trainer for assistance while building strength 3. Non-working leg position: Forward (pistol style) = harder balance; behind (airborne lunge) = easier balance 4. Depth targets: Quarter squat → parallel → full depth as mobility/strength improves 5. Glute medius cue: Focus on preventing hip drop on non-stance side—critical for knee health | Biscarini A et al. (2020). EMG analysis of single-leg squat. Gait Posture 77:133-141; Boudreau SN et al. (2009). EMG comparison: 2-leg vs single-leg squat. J Strength Cond Res 24(10):2734-2743; Saeterbakken AH et al.

| Single-Leg Box Squat | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris), Gluteus Maximus, Gluteus Medius (emphasized) | Hamstrings, Core stabilizers, Erector Spinae, Adductors | Compound | Plyometric box or bench (12-20 inches) | Intermediate | Lower | Push | Bodyweight | 1. Stand on right leg in front of box (12-20 inches high), left leg hovering 2. Extend arms forward for counterbalance 3. Lower body by bending right knee and pushing hips back 4. Lightly touch box with glutes (don't sit fully) 5. Immediately drive through right heel to return to standing 6. Complete all reps on right leg, then switch | 1. Box height: 16-20 inches = beginner; 12-15 inches = intermediate; <12 inches = advanced 2. Touch-and-go: Lightly tap box—don't relax or sit down (maintains muscle tension) 3. Non-working leg: Hold forward (pistol position) or behind (airborne lunge position) 4. Knee tracking: Working knee tracks over 2nd-3rd toe—prevent knee valgus (inward collapse) 5. Progression: Bodyweight → vest → goblet DB → barbell → lower box height | Biscarini A et al. (2020). EMG during single-leg squat. Gait Posture 77:133-141; Distefano LJ et al. (2009). Gluteal activation. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 39(12):532-540; Swinton PA et al. (2012). Biomechanical comparison of squat variations.

| Single-Leg Dumbbell Box Squat | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris), Gluteus Maximus, Gluteus Medius | Hamstrings, Core stabilizers, Erector Spinae, Adductors | Compound | Dumbbell (single or pair), plyometric box or bench (12-20 inches) | Intermediate | Lower | Push | Free Weight | 1. Stand on right leg in front of box (12-20 inches), holding dumbbell(s) at sides 2. Left leg extended forward for counterbalance 3. Lower body by bending right knee and pushing hips back 4. Lightly touch box with glutes without fully sitting 5. Drive through right heel to return to standing 6. Complete all reps on right leg, then switch | 1. Load options: Single DB (goblet hold at chest) = easier balance; dual DBs (at sides) = harder balance 2. Box height progression: High box (20 inches) → medium (16 inches) → low (12 inches) → no box (pistol squat) 3. Tempo control: 3-second descent, light touch, explosive ascent maximizes quad eccentric + concentric 4. Hip stability: Prevent hip drop on non-stance side—activates glute medius maximally 5. Regression: If balance limiting factor, use suspension trainer for hand support while building strength | Biscarini A et al. (2020). EMG of single-leg squat. Gait Posture 77:133-141; Boudreau SN et al. (2009). EMG comparison: 2-leg vs single-leg squat. J Strength Cond Res 24(10):2734-2743; Distefano LJ et al. (2009). Gluteal muscle activation.

Stand on right leg, hold dumbbell at chest (goblet position) or dumbbells at sides 2. Extend left leg forward for counterbalance (pistol position) 3. Lower body by bending right knee and pushing hips back 4. Descend as deep as mobility allows while maintaining balance 5. Keep right knee tracking over toes, chest up 6. Push through right heel to return to standing 7. Complete all reps on right leg, then switch | 1. Prerequisite: Master bodyweight pistol squats before adding dumbbells 2. Load progression: Goblet hold (single DB at chest) = easier; dual DBs at sides = harder balance demand 3. Depth targets: Quarter depth → parallel → full depth (hamstring to calf contact) 4. Ankle mobility: Requires significant ankle dorsiflexion—elevate heel on plate if limited mobility 5. Assistance options: Hold TRX/suspension trainer with one hand while learning movement pattern | Biscarini A et al. (2020). EMG analysis of single-leg squat. Gait Posture 77:133-141; Boudreau SN et al. (2009). Lower extremity EMG comparison. J Strength Cond Res 24(10):2734-2743; Distefano LJ et al. (2009). Gluteal muscle activation.

| Single-Leg Squat | Quadriceps (Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris), Gluteus Maximus, Gluteus Medius (emphasized) | Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris), Core stabilizers (anti-rotation, anti-lateral flexion), Erector Spinae, Adductors, Ankle stabilizers (Tibialis Anterior, Gastrocnemius/Soleus) | Compound | Bodyweight | Advanced | Lower | Push | Bodyweight | 1. Stand on right leg, extend left leg forward (parallel to floor if possible) 2. Extend arms forward for counterbalance 3. Lower body by bending right knee and pushing hips back 4. Descend as deep as mobility allows while keeping left leg extended 5. Keep right knee tracking over toes, chest up 6. Push through right heel to return to standing 7. Complete all reps on right leg, then switch | 1. Prerequisite strength: Must perform 15-20 bodyweight squats with excellent form before attempting pistols 2. Progression pathway: Box pistols (high box) → box pistols (low box) → full pistol → weighted pistol 3. Counterbalance: Extended leg and arms create counterweight—pull non-working leg toward chest at bottom 4. Ankle mobility: Requires extreme ankle dorsiflexion—elevate heel on small plate if limited 5. Common faults: Knee valgus (collapse inward), heel lift, forward torso lean—address each systematically | Biscarini A et al. (2020). EMG analysis of single-leg squat. Gait Posture 77:133-141; Boudreau SN et al. (2009). EMG comparison: 2-leg vs single-leg squat. J Strength Cond Res 24(10):2734-2743; Distefano LJ et al. (2009).

| Smith Machine Squat | Quadriceps (Vastus Medialis, Vastus Lateralis, Rectus Femoris) | Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings, Adductors, Erector Spinae (reduced) | Compound | Smith Machine | Beginner | Lower | Push | Machine | 1. Position Smith machine bar at upper back level, load appropriate weight 2. Step under bar, position across upper back (high bar) or rear delts (low bar) 3. Unrack by rotating bar hooks upward 4. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly outward 5. Lower body by bending knees and hips until thighs parallel to floor 6. Push through heels to return to starting position 7. Rotate bar hooks to rerack | 1. Fixed path limitation: Smith machine reduces quad activation by 43-49% vs free weights—prioritize free squats when possible 2. Safety advantage: Can rerack at any point—useful for training to failure without spotter 3. Foot position: Can place feet forward of bar (impossible with free weight)—shifts emphasis to glutes/hamstrings 4. Biomechanical constraint: Fixed vertical path may not suit individual biomechanics—some lifters experience knee/hip discomfort 5. Use cases: Rehabilitation, beginner learning squat pattern, high-rep burnout sets, when training alone without spotter | Schick EE et al. (2010). Comparison of free weight squat to Smith machine squat using EMG. J Strength Cond Res 24(3):779-784. DOI: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181cc2237; Schwanbeck S et al. (2009).
