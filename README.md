3. Use approved colors: Deep Charcoal (#1E1F22), Off-White (#EBE7D9), Accent Red (#F55139)
4. Reference `context_files/02-coachwhitt-framework.md` for messaging guidelines

## Workflow System

### Batch Processing
- 20-exercise batches for quality and momentum consistency
- Systematic extraction from Origym.csv
- Research using Gemini research agent with exercise_research_prompt.md
- Integration into comprehensive_exercise_database_v2.md

### Progress Tracking
- Origym.csv: Primary tracking (40/270 COMPLETE, 230 PENDING)
- Batch reference files: batch_1a_exercises.txt, batch_1b_exercises.txt, etc.
- Session summaries for continuity between sessions

### Quality Standards
- 3-4 peer-reviewed scientific references per exercise
- Specific anatomical muscle names (Latin terminology)
- 16-column metadata structure maintained for automation
- Sports application tags (3-5 per exercise)

## Known Issues

### Character Encoding (Priority: Low)
- Some degree symbols may display as "Â°" in certain fields
- Does not affect data accuracy, only display
- Can be resolved with UTF-8 conversion if needed

### Video Links (Priority: Medium)
- Batch 1-2: Video links marked as [TBD]
- User to verify accuracy before client use
- ExRx and JEFIT integration available

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Add Batch 2a to Database** - 20 back rowing exercises (research already complete in back_rowing_exercises_research.md)
2. **Research Batch 2b** - 3 back + 17 biceps exercises using Gemini
3. **Add Batch 2b to Database** - If time permits within token budget
4. **Extract Batch 3** - Next 40 exercises from Origym.csv for future processing
