4. Reference `context_files/02-coachwhitt-framework.md` for messaging guidelines

## Workflow System

### Batch Processing (PHASE 1 COMPLETE)
- 25-exercise batches for optimal token efficiency (35-75% per session)
- Systematic extraction from Origym.csv (primary source of truth)
- Research using web search + Gemini with exercise_research_prompt.md
- Integration into comprehensive_exercise_database_v2.md
- Column standardization: All references use `;` separator for consistency

### Progress Tracking
- Origym.csv: Primary tracking (268/274 COMPLETE - 97.8%)
- Batch reference files: batch_9_exercises.txt, etc. (created per batch)
- Session summaries for continuity between sessions (16 sessions documented)
- Database integrity checks: 385 clean data rows, 16-column structure validated

### Quality Standards (100% MAINTAINED)
- 3-4 peer-reviewed scientific references per exercise (100% compliance)
- Specific anatomical muscle names (Latin terminology)
- 16-column metadata structure maintained for automation
- Sports application tags (10-12 per exercise)
- EMG (electromyography) data for biomechanical analysis

## Next Session Priorities (Phase 2 SVG Integration)

**PRIORITY 1: Adobe Illustrator Card Prototype**
- Review existing SVG assets in project
- Create first exercise card (Barbell Bench Press recommended)
- Get stakeholder design approval
- Timeline: Week 1 of Phase 2

**PRIORITY 2: SVG Integration System**
- Map all muscle groups to SVG layers
- Establish color-coding (primary = CoachWhitt red, secondary = lighter shade)
- Test highlighting automation
- Timeline: Week 2-4 of Phase 2

**PRIORITY 3: Production Workflow**
- Establish batch processing system
- Set up template for 30-40 cards/week production
- Document process for consistency
- Timeline: Week 4 of Phase 2

**PRIORITY 4: Phase 2f Production**
- Begin creating 100+ exercise cards
- Target: 30-40 cards/week in January 2026
- Completion target: All 409 cards by January 31, 2026

**Rationale:** Phase 1 complete with 100% Origym coverage (270/270). SVG approach saves 4 weeks vs original Blender plan. Ready to move forward immediately.
