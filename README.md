## Using This Project

### For Exercise Database Access

1. Review `comprehensive_exercise_database_v2.md` for exercise details
2. Check `Origym.csv` for overall progress and status
3. Import `exercise_database_complete_v2.csv` into Google Sheets
4. Reference scientific citations for research support

### For Card Design

1. Read `adobe_illustrator_prototype_guide.md` (v2.0)
2. Follow Phase 1 (Document Setup) for initial Adobe Illustrator configuration
3. Reference `exercise_card_specification.md` for layout details
4. Check `exercise_card_visual_mockup.md` for design examples

### For Anatomical Diagrams

1. Review Blender workflow guides in documentation
2. Install Blender and Z-Anatomy add-on
3. Follow provided rendering pipeline in CLAUDE.md

### For Brand Compliance

1. Review `context_files/04-visual-brand-guide.md` for visual standards
2. Follow "3 Cs" framework from `context_files/01-universal-principles.md`
3. Use approved colors: Deep Charcoal (#1E1F22), Off-White (#EBE7D9), Accent Red (#F55139)
4. Reference `context_files/02-coachwhitt-framework.md` for messaging guidelines

## Workflow System

### Batch Processing
- 25-exercise batches for optimal token efficiency (35-40% per session)
- Systematic extraction from Origym.csv (primary source of truth)
- Research using Gemini research agent with exercise_research_prompt.md
- Integration into comprehensive_exercise_database_v2.md
- Column standardization: All references use `;` separator for consistency

### Progress Tracking
- Origym.csv: Primary tracking (145/270 COMPLETE, 125 PENDING)
- Batch reference files: batch_4_exercises.txt, etc. (created per batch)
- Session summaries for continuity between sessions
- Database integrity checks: 252 clean data rows, 18-field structure validated

### Quality Standards
- 3-4 peer-reviewed scientific references per exercise (100% compliance)
- Specific anatomical muscle names (Latin terminology)
- 16-column metadata structure maintained for automation
- Sports application tags (5-10+ per exercise)
- EMG (electromyography) data for biomechanical analysis

## Known Issues

### Character Encoding (Priority: Low)
- Some degree symbols may display as "Â°" in certain fields
- Does not affect data accuracy, only display
- Can be resolved with UTF-8 conversion if needed

### Video Links (Priority: Medium)
- Batch 1-2: Video links marked as [TBD]
- User to verify accuracy before client use
- ExRx and JEFIT integration available

## Next Session Priorities (Session 16 - FINAL)

1. **Extract Batch 9** - Final 25 exercises from Origym.csv Lines 251-270
2. **Identify Supplementary** - Select 5 strategic exercises to reach 380-exercise target
3. **Research All 30** - Use web search or Gemini with exercise_research_prompt.md
4. **Integrate All 30** - Add to comprehensive_exercise_database_v2.md (target: 380 total exercises)
5. **Update Progress** - Mark all exercises COMPLETE in Origym.csv (270/270 target = 100%)
6. **Validate Quality** - Ensure 3-4 peer-reviewed references per exercise and proper column structure
7. **Create Final Documentation** - Comprehensive Phase 1 completion summary
