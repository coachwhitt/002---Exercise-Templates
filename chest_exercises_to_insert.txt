| Alternating Dumbbell Bench Press | Pectoralis Major (sternal head), Pectoralis Major (clavicular head) | Anterior Deltoid, Triceps Brachii, Core stabilizers (anti-rotation) | Compound | Dumbbells, Flat Bench | Intermediate | Upper | Push | Free Weight | 1. Lie supine on flat bench holding dumbbells at chest level 2. Position feet flat on floor, maintain neutral spine 3. Start with both dumbbells at chest, elbows at 45° 4. Press ONE dumbbell up to full elbow extension 5. Lower that dumbbell while pressing opposite dumbbell up 6. Continue alternating in controlled rhythm 7. Maintain constant core tension to resist rotation | 1. Massive anti-rotation core demand—transverse abdominis and obliques highly active 2. Unilateral loading identifies left/right chest strength imbalances 3. Time under tension doubled per side vs bilateral pressing 4. Breathing: exhale during press, inhale during lowering of each rep 5. Perfect for athletic programs requiring rotational stability | Solari F & Burns B (2023). Pectoralis Major Anatomy.

Lie supine on flat bench, eyes under barbell 2. Grip bar slightly wider than shoulder-width 3. Unrack bar to arms extended position above chest 4. Lower bar to mid-chest with elbows at 45° 5. Touch chest lightly without bouncing 6. Press bar up to full elbow extension 7. Maintain shoulder blade retraction throughout | 1. King of upper body pressing—highest load potential for pec development 2. Bar path: slight arc from mid-chest to above shoulders at lockout 3. Leg drive: push feet into floor to maintain upper back tightness 4. Balanced sternal and clavicular head activation on flat angle 5. Greater triceps activation than dumbbell press due to fixed hand position | Solari F & Burns B (2023). Pectoralis Major Anatomy. StatPearls | Rodríguez-Ridao D et al. (2020).

| Chest Press (Machine) | Pectoralis Major (sternal head), Pectoralis Major (clavicular head) | Anterior Deltoid, Triceps Brachii | Compound | Chest Press Machine | Beginner | Upper | Push | Machine | 1. Adjust seat height so handles align with mid-chest 2. Sit with back flat against pad, feet on floor 3. Grip handles with neutral or pronated grip 4. Press handles forward to full arm extension 5. Pause briefly at full extension 6. Lower with control to starting position 7. Avoid allowing weight stack to touch between reps | 1. Fixed path eliminates stabilizer recruitment—pure pec isolation 2.

| Decline Dumbbell Bench Press | Pectoralis Major (sternal head - emphasized), Pectoralis Major (clavicular head) | Anterior Deltoid (reduced vs flat/incline), Triceps Brachii | Compound | Dumbbells, Decline Bench | Intermediate | Upper | Push | Free Weight | 1. Secure feet under leg supports on decline bench 2. Lie back on decline (15-30° angle) holding dumbbells 3. Position dumbbells at chest level, elbows at 45° 4. Press dumbbells up to full extension above lower chest 5. Lower with control allowing stretch below chest level 6. Press back up, optionally bring dumbbells together at top 7. Maintain constant tension on pectorals throughout | 1. Maximal sternal (lower) pectoralis major activation due to decline angle 2. Minimal anterior deltoid involvement compared to flat/incline 3. Dumbbells allow greater ROM than barbell (descend below chest) 4. Adduction at top (bringing DBs together) increases pec contraction 5. Enhanced safety vs decline barbell—drop dumbbells if needed | Solari F & Burns B (2023). Pectoralis Major Anatomy. StatPearls | Rodríguez-Ridao D et al. (2020). Bench angle effects on pectoralis EMG.

| Decline Smith Machine Bench Press | Pectoralis Major (sternal head - emphasized), Pectoralis Major (clavicular head) | Anterior Deltoid (reduced), Triceps Brachii | Compound | Smith Machine, Decline Bench | Beginner | Upper | Push | Machine | 1. Position decline bench under Smith machine bar 2. Secure feet under leg supports 3. Lie back on decline, position bar above lower chest 4. Unrack bar and lower to lower chest with control 5. Press bar up to full extension 6. Rerack at any point using safety hooks 7. Maintain shoulder blade retraction throughout | 1. Fixed vertical path allows focus on lower pec contraction 2. Safer for training to failure without spotter (rerack anytime) 3. Reduced stabilizer demand vs free weight decline press 4. Great for isolating sternal pectoralis major fibers 5. Linear bar path may not suit all individual biomechanics | Solari F & Burns B (2023). Pectoralis Major Anatomy. StatPearls | Rodríguez-Ridao D et al. (2020). Bench angle effects.

Sit on flat bench holding dumbbells on thighs 2. Lie back while bringing dumbbells to chest level 3. Position feet flat on floor, maintain neutral spine 4. Press dumbbells up to full extension above chest 5. Lower with control, allowing elbows to descend below chest level 6. Press back up, optionally bring dumbbells together at top 7. Maintain shoulder blade retraction throughout | 1. Greater pectoralis activation than barbell due to increased ROM 2. Descend dumbbells below chest level for deep stretch 3.

| Dumbbell Push-Up | Pectoralis Major (sternal head), Pectoralis Major (clavicular head) | Anterior Deltoid, Triceps Brachii, Core stabilizers (rectus abdominis, obliques), Serratus Anterior | Compound | Dumbbells (hexagonal preferred) | Intermediate | Upper | Push | Bodyweight | 1. Place two hexagonal dumbbells on floor shoulder-width apart 2. Grip dumbbell handles in push-up position 3. Body in straight plank: shoulders to ankles in line 4. Lower body by bending elbows to 90° 5. Descend slightly deeper than normal push-up (below hand level) 6. Press back up to full elbow extension 7. Maintain rigid core throughout movement | 1. Elevated hand position increases ROM vs floor push-ups 2. Neutral grip (palms facing) reduces shoulder stress vs pronated 3. Enhanced grip strength and forearm activation from holding dumbbells 4. Unstable surface increases core and stabilizer demand 5. Progress to single-arm variations for anti-rotation core work | Solari F & Burns B (2023). Pectoralis Major Anatomy.

| Elevated Push-Up | Pectoralis Major (clavicular head - emphasized), Pectoralis Major (sternal head) | Anterior Deltoid (increased activation), Triceps Brachii, Core stabilizers | Compound | Elevated Surface (bench, box, or platform) | Intermediate | Upper | Push | Bodyweight | 1. Place hands on elevated surface (bench/box) shoulder-width apart 2. Walk feet back to create straight plank position 3. Body angle: feet lower than hands (incline position) 4. Lower chest toward elevated surface by bending elbows 5. Descend until chest nearly touches surface 6. Press back up to full elbow extension 7. Maintain rigid core and neutral spine | 1. Incline angle emphasizes clavicular (upper) pectoralis major 2. Higher elevation = greater upper pec/anterior deltoid activation 3. Regression for beginners: higher surface = easier resistance 4. Progress by lowering surface height until reaching floor push-ups 5. Narrow hand position increases pectoralis and triceps activation | Solari F & Burns B (2023). Pectoralis Major Anatomy.
