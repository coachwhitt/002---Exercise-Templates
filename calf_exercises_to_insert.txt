| Barbell Calf Raise | Gastrocnemius (medial head), Gastrocnemius (lateral head) | Soleus, Core stabilizers (erector spinae, rectus abdominis, obliques) | Isolation | Barbell, Raised Platform | Intermediate | Lower | Push | Free Weight | 1.

Keep knees fully extended—any flexion shifts work to soleus 2. Full ROM: minimum 4-inch stretch below, 3+ inches above 3. Vary tempo: explosive concentric for power, slow for hypertrophy 4. Foot variation: toes forward (balanced), outward (medial head), inward (lateral head) 5. Progress to 1.5-2x bodyweight for advanced development | Nunes JP et al. (2020).

Sit in leg press machine with appropriate weight 2. Place balls of feet on bottom edge of footplate, heels hanging off 3. Extend legs fully, keeping knees straight 4. Release safety locks 5. Flex ankles to let footplate move toward you for stretch 6. Press through balls of feet to extend ankles maximally 7. Hold peak contraction 1-2 seconds, return to stretch | 1. Locked knees—no flexion or quadriceps engagement 2. Machine allows 3-4x bodyweight for advanced hypertrophy 3. Use stretch reflex: pause briefly at bottom then explode 4. Single-leg variation: use 50-60% bilateral weight per leg 5. High frequency: 12-20 sets/week across 3-4 sessions optimal | Nunes JP et al. (2020). Seated vs standing calf raises.

| Calf Raise - Seated | Gastrocnemius (medial head - reduced), Gastrocnemius (lateral head - reduced) | Soleus (NOTE: Actually PRIMARY due to knee flexion placing gastrocnemius in active insufficiency) | Isolation | Bench, Dumbbells or Weight Plates, Raised Platform | Beginner | Lower | Push | Free Weight | 1. Sit on bench with feet flat on floor 2. Place platform under balls of feet 3. Position weights on thighs just above knees 4. Drop heels to floor level for starting stretch 5. Push through balls of feet to lift heels maximally 6. Squeeze calves at peak for 1-2 seconds 7.

Unrack bar and straighten body, heels hanging off platform 5. Lower heels below platform for deep calf stretch 6. Push through balls of feet to rise onto tiptoes maximally 7. Squeeze calves at top, lower with control to stretch | 1. Fixed vertical path reduces balance demands vs free weight barbell 2. Allows focus purely on calf contraction without stabilization 3. Safer for heavy loads—can rerack easily at any point 4. Linear bar path may not suit all body mechanics (slight forward lean natural) 5.

| Seated Calf Raise | Soleus | Gastrocnemius (medial head - minimal), Gastrocnemius (lateral head - minimal) | Isolation | Seated Calf Raise Machine | Beginner | Lower | Push | Machine | 1. Sit in seated calf raise machine, adjust knee pad height 2. Place balls of feet on footplate, heels hanging off 3. Position knee pad across thighs just above knees 4. Release safety lever, allow heels to drop below footplate 5. Push through balls of feet to raise heels maximally 6. Squeeze calves at peak for 1-2 seconds 7. Lower heels with control to stretched position | 1. Primary soleus exercise due to 90° knee flexion (active insufficiency of gastrocnemius) 2. Soleus Type I fibers: use 15-30 reps, longer TUT, moderate loads 3. Machine provides stable progressive overload superior to free weight seated 4. Essential for complete calf development (pair with standing variations) 5. Pause reps: 3-5 second holds at top maximize metabolic stress | Avery DM & Tan JM (2023). Soleus Muscle Anatomy.
